The first successful restaurant in this building was started by David Rasmussen shortly after the Administration Building opened. As described in \"Men, Money and Mud\" a history of San Francisco International Airport written in 1954, Rasmussen \"arrived literally equipped with a bucket of 'spuds,' a pairing knife, a pound of hamburger, a pound of coffee, a set of dishes, and one match to light the stove. 'If the match had gone out,' he was to recall years later, 'I would have been out of business. I didn't have enough money to buy another.'\"",
