        "body": "Even after a year of staying home, it's hard to imagine life without shampoo, which emerged in the early twentieth century. Around the same time, in 1906, African American entrepreneur Madam C. J. Walker launched her ultra-successful Wonderful Hair Grower promising to grow hair long and strong. In the ensuing decades, women applied a setting lotion, such as Jo-cur, to create finger waves and pin curls. Hairspray surfaced in the 1940s and during the 1950s, high-volume hairstyles created a great demand for it. By the mid-1960s, hairspray became the top selling beauty product in the United States.
