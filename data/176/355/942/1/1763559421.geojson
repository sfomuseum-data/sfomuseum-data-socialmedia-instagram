        "body": "Despite owning at least three potteries in South Carolina, Collin Rhodes likely never worked as a potter himself. The most common motif employed at his C. Rhodes Factory was the maker’s mark, boldly lettered in slip to distinguish it from other makers. Cream-colored numerals often adorned pots indicating gallon capacity. Decorators embellished some wares with loops, swags, and floral patterns. Rhodes successfully sold wares throughout the state before selling his factory to John Seigler in 1853 and moving to Louisiana.   See “Stoneware Stories: Folk Pottery of Edgefield, South Carolina” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/StonewareStories",
