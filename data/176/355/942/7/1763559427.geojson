        "body": "New exhibition alert! When modern science emerged in the seventeenth century, scientists invented specialized instruments to explore the world and universe in a closer, more logical manner. These intriguing devices facilitated the careful study of almost all facets of life through research and demonstration of ideas and theories.  During the nineteenth century, an array of devices assisted some of the most brilliant minds on Earth as scientists discovered progressive subjects such as electrodynamics and atomic theory. This exhibition features a selection of rare mid-nineteenth to early-twentieth-century instruments from a variety of scientific fields.   “Curiosity \u0026 Discovery: Antique Scientific Instruments” is on display, post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1.
