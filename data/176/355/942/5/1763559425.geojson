This was the Airport's first major addition since the Central Terminal (now Terminal 2) was completed in 1954. The Central Terminal had been built to handle a peak capacity of five million passengers – and over six million had travelled through SFO in the 1962 fiscal year! The addition of the South Terminal increased the Airport’s capability to handle up to twelve million passengers. Ten airlines moved to the new facility to occupy the two new passenger piers while six remained in the Central Terminal.",
