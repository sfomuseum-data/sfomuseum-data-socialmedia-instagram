        "body": "Igor Sikorsky was born in Kyiv, in modern day Ukraine in 1889. In 1923, Sikorsky founded the Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corporation (later renamed the Sikorsky Manufacturing Company, followed by the reorganized Sikorsky Aviation Corporation). Sikorsky helped create the S-38 amphibian, which Pan American Airways and its subsidiaries extensively operated in the Caribbean, and Central and South America; the S-40, which at the time was the world's largest amphibian aircraft; and the S-42, the flying boat that Pan American flew on numerous transpacific survey flights. The company also went on to create the first large-scale mass-produced helicopter, the Sikorsky R-4. Igor Sikorsky Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany) is named in his honor.",
