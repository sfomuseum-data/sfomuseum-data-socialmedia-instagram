        "body": "This week's installment of Defunct Thursday is the second part of CNAC's story.  As Japan waged war on China in 1937, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) evacuated Shanghai, its original headquarters and home base in August and relocated to Chongqing. In trying to avoid Japanese detection, the airline pioneered the routes over the Himalayas.   After the Allied victory in August 1945, the airline secured a system of eight primary routes throughout China all the while struggling against a backdrop of increasing civil war. By the end of 1949, with the proclamation of the new People’s Republic of China by Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, many of CNAC’s assets were absorbed by the new government.
