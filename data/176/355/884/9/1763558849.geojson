The Douglas DC-2 was developed in the early 1930s and introduced in 1934. The DC-2 had a capacity for fourteen passengers, and proved a safe, reliable, and comfortable airliner with a maximum speed of 210 mph. Fewer than 200 were built, as its successor, the DC-3, one of the most successful airliners ever, was introduced the following year.",
