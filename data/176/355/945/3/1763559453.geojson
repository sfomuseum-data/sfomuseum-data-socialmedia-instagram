        "body": "The Lockheed L-1011 TriStar was a wide-body, long-range tri-jet airliner introduced in 1972. It featured state-of-the-art avionics, including an autopilot with the capability of virtually flying and landing by itself, including in low-visibility weather conditions.   Airlines touted its twin aisle, wide-body passenger comforts, ease of operation, and reduced environmental impact. The coach section featured a full-service bar surrounded by small alcoves for socializing and was equipped with twin passenger seats that TWA (Trans World Airlines) claimed were the “finest coach seats in the world.” Like the Boeing 747 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the galley was placed below, in the luggage compartment, and meals were brought up via elevators to allow for the easier flow of carts and passengers in the cabin.   Despite its accolades, only 250 were built, well short of the projected 500, causing Lockheed to permanently retreat from commercial airliner production amid considerable financial losses. It was Lockheed’s first and only entry into the widebody airliner market.",
