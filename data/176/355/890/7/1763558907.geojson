        "body": "By the turn of the twentieth century, a number of hair products became available to women. In 1906, African American entrepreneur Madam C. J. Walker launched her ultra-successful Wonderful Hair Grower promising to grow hair long and strong. In the ensuing decades, women applied a setting lotion, such as Jo-cur, to create finger waves and pin curls. Hair shampoo emerged in the early twentieth century, while hairspray surfaced in the 1940s. During the 1950s, high-volume hairstyles created a greater demand for hairspray, and by the mid-1960s, hairspray became the top selling beauty product in the United States.
