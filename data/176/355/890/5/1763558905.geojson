First operated by the Dutch airline KLM (Royal Dutch Airlines), the F.VII and its variants, the F.VIIa, F.VIIa/3m and F.VIIb/3m, were used in many pioneering and record-breaking flights around the world, including the inauguration of Pan American Airway's airmail service in 1927 and passenger service in 1928, Amelia Earhart's first transatlantic flight as a passenger in 1928, and Charles Kingsford Smith and crew’s 1928 transpacific flight in a modified F.VIIb/3m named “The Southern Cross,” from Oakland to Brisbane, Australia. With a maximum speed of 130 mph, a cruising speed of just over 100mph, and a capacity of 8 passengers, the Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor was a groundbreaking aircraft of the late 1920s.   photograph: Pan American Airways, Fokker F.VII c. 1927 SFO Museum Collection Gift of Vernon W.
