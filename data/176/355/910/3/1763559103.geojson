        "body": "For many guitarists, customized gear is essential to the look and sound of surf music. This tradition dates to 1961, when Leo Fender modified a Fender Stratocaster with a left-handed neck for Dick Dale. Topped with a wild, gold-sparkle paint job, Dale’s Stratocaster influenced others to personalize their own equipment.   In recent years, Dave Wronski hand-crafted a series of customized Fender Jaguar guitars for his progressive, Southern California surf music trio Slacktone. The blue-sparkle Jaguar features an original 1963 maple neck with rosewood fretboard, a custom-carved alder body finished in metallic nitrocellulose lacquer, upgraded electronics, hand-wound pickups, and a pickup selector that simplifies the Jaguar’s problematic switching system. The original Fender Reverb unit and Echoplex tape delay also shown add to the signature Slacktone sound.   See more in “Surf’s Up!
