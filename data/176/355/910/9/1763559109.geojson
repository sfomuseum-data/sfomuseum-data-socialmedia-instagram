        "body": "The L-1649 Starliner, the final variant in Lockheed’s Constellation-based design series, embodied the zenith in large-capacity, piston-engine airliner development, rivaled only by the Douglas DC-7C, with which it was designed to compete. The main fuselage was similar to the L-1049 Super Constellation, but the wings had a completely new design. Lengthened, squared-off, and capable of carrying a large reservoir of fuel, they provided comparable range to the DC-7C, while offering an efficient low-drag, high-altitude airfoil.   Initial deliveries of the aircraft went to TWA (Trans World Airlines), which inaugurated service on its New York, London, and Frankfurt route in June 1957. The airline also inaugurated trans-polar service between the U.S. West Coast and Europe with the Starliner the same year. Named the “Jetstream” by TWA, the aircraft had a 100-passenger capacity and could cruise at a speed of 300 mph. Lufthansa and Air France were the only carriers besides TWA to operate the L-1649 on the transatlantic route. Lufthansa received four 1649 Starliners between 1957 and 1958. Forty-four of the aircraft were produced and by the early 1960s, with the end of the propliner era, they were replaced by the much faster Boeing 707 jetliner.",
