Nine gates opened with Southwest Airlines and JetBlue flights arriving and departing from the new terminal. The first airport terminal in the world named for an LGBTQ+ leader, Harvey Milk Terminal 1 features our exhibition “Harvey Milk: Messenger of Hope.” With images, correspondence, and campaign materials on display, our exhibition provides a glimpse into Milk’s life, including his activism and ascendance as a political leader in San Francisco, his assassination, and his enduring legacy in the continued push for diversity, equity, and inclusion.   See “Harvey Milk: Messenger of Hope” on display pre-security in the Harvey Milk Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/HarveyMilkExhibition",
