        "body": "In 1960, Delta Airlines proudly introduced the 615 miles-per-hour Convair 880, produced by the Convair Division of General Dynamics, of San Diego, California. The 880 was smaller than the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, yet significantly faster. The medium-to-long-range aircraft had a narrow body, sharply swept-back wings, and a capacity for up to 110 passengers. The aircraft was claimed to be the fastest commercial jetliner in service at the time with a maximum cruise speed of 615mph. While operated by Delta Air Lines, it set several speed records. In January 1962, the airliner achieved a record top speed of 715 mph on a flight from Chicago to Miami. Delta initially packaged its 880 flights as a premium service configured for seventy-two first-class passengers. Its first-class lounge was touted as the largest available in a jetliner.",
