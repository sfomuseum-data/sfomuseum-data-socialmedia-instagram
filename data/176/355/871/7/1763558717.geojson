        "body": "The universe is central to Mayan mythology and often appears symbolically in traditional weaving. Illustrated by a diamond motif sometimes referred to as the \"Grand Design,\" its four sides represent the boundaries of space and time. Smaller diamonds at the points of the symbol mark cardinal directions, with curl motifs that extend from the central diamond to recreate movement of the sun across the sky. Implemented in rows, the universe design shows the continuation of time through its repetition.
