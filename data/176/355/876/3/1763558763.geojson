        "body": "The all-metal, twin-engine Boeing Model 247 was a revolutionary airplane when introduced in 1933. Often referred to as the first modern airliner, it featured numerous advancements including all-aluminum, semi-monocoque construction, a cantilevered wing, wing flaps, variable pitch propellers, trim tabs, autopilot, and semi-retractable landing gear. It entered service with United Air Lines in 1933. Seventy-five of the aircraft were eventually built, with most going to the United Air Lines’ fleet. The aircraft was primarily operated on United’s “Mainline” transcontinental route until the mid 1930s. Although advanced for its time, the Model 247 accommodated only ten passengers, which made it less economical to operate than larger capacity airliners, particularly the more fuel-efficient, fourteen-seat Douglas DC-2, introduced a year later.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
