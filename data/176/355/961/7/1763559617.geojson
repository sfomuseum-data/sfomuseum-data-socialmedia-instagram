        "body": "The first flight of the Boeing 247 took off #onthisday in 1933. Often referred to as the first modern airliner, United Air Lines, initially the sole U.S. operator, emphasized the new ten-passenger airliner’s dependability, comfort, and speed. The aircraft was primarily operated on United’s “Mainline” transcontinental route until the mid 1930s. Boeing produced a clean, low-drag fuselage, with no wires or struts common to most airliners at that time, by using semi-monocoque construction with a fully cantilevered wing, and retractable landing gear. Seventy-five of the aircraft were eventually built, with most going to the United Air Lines fleet.",
