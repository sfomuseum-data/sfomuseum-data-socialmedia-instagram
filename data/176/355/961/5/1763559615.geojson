In 1928, Paul Revere Braniff convinced his brother, Thomas E. Braniff, to invest in an aviation company they first named Tulsa-Oklahoma City Airways. They formed a new company in 1930 and named it Braniff Airways. With a Chicago–Dallas airmail contract awarded in 1934, they soon added service to the U.S.–Mexico border. After World War II, it flew internationally to the Caribbean, Mexico, and other parts of Latin America, and began doing business as Braniff International Airways.",
