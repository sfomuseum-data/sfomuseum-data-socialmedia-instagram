        "body": "Not one, but TWO exhibitions and galleries opened this week! The first, Flight Patterns, is a look at how social changes affected airline uniforms in the 1960s-70s, and the second, Stoneware Stories, examines the unique folk pottery produced in Edgefield, South Carolina, in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Flight Patterns is on display in a brand new gallery located post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. If you're flying via the A gates in the International Terminal, you can see it, too, (as well as many new works of public art!) via the new post-security connector between the A and B boarding areas.  Stoneware Stories is on display pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall, near the security checkpoint for the A gates. The gallery, like its still-closed twin on the G-side, has been re-imagined for smaller, intimate exhibits.   Check out both exhibitions online: sfomuseum.org \u003c-- also via bio.",
