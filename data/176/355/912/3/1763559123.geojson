        "body": "Harvey Milk (1930–78) made history in 1977 when he became the first openly gay individual elected to public office in the state of California. He would serve just eleven months on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors before his assassination on November 27, 1978. Today, Harvey Milk’s legacy is felt in the gains for LGBTQ rights made during the four decades since his tragic death, including the 2015 United States Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage as a legal right.   Learn more about Harvey Milk's life and legacy in our exhibition, \"Messenger of Hope,\" which is on view pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. Not traveling?
