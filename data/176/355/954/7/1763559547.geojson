It was designed to be a pressurized, mid-range replacement for the DC-3 that was easy to service and turnover between flights. It featured a built-in, drop-down stairway for quick passenger loading, petal-style engine cowlings for rapid maintenance, and tricycle-configuration landing gear. It could carry forty passengers comfortably and had a range of up to 1,200 miles. Introduced by American Airlines in 1948, 176 were produced for numerous airlines worldwide.",
