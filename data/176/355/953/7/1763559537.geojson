Well known for dressing Marilyn Monroe, Travilla created this synthetic blend, summer seasonal ensemble for United in a new color named Blue Frost. The lightly fitted jacket has a distinct chelsea collar and a three-quarter-length sleeve with a detachable dropped cuff. The short sleeve blouse has a banded waist and an attached jabot neckpiece for the insignia pin. Smart looking and allowing greater ease of mobility for the demands of jet service, it was issued from 1965 to 1968 and became known as “the cheerleader” because of its flared skirt.",
