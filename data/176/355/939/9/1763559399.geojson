To build the 747, the largest commercial airliner at the time, Boeing had to construct a new assembly plant. The purpose-built plant is the largest building in the world by volume, with a total volume of 13,385,378 cubic meters (472,370,319 cubic feet), covering a floor area of 399,480 square meters (98.3 acres). The factory was completed in 1967, and within it a large group of Boeing employees nicknamed \"The Incredibles\" built the first 747-100. Have you ever been to the Boeing assembly building in Everett, Washington?",
