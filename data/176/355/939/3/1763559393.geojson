Although Yosemite was the third national park, land in the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias had been federally protected since 1864 by President Abraham Lincoln. Yosemite Falls, is shown on this United Air Lines calendar from the late 1940s.   Message from the seven tribes of Yosemite: We are still here. Yosemite is home. Since the beginning of time, we the people now known as the Mono Lake Kutzadikaa Tribe, Bishop Paiute Tribe, Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians, Bridgeport Indian Colony, North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California, and Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians have stewarded the lands now known as Yosemite. As you walk through this park, remember who walked here before you and imagine who will walk here after you. Please join us and Yosemite National Park in protecting and preserving our ancestral homelands for our future generations.",
