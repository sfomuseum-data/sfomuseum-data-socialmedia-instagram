        "body": "Happy Birthday Jean Louis! The famed Hollywood costumer Jean Louis was born on this day in Paris, France, in 1907. Louis introduced his third-consecutive flight attendant uniform for United Air Lines in 1973. Available in three primary colors of blue, green, and red, this interchangeable, mix-and-match series was designed to give cabin crew even more creativity in their daily choice of uniforms. A jumper dress, vest, skirt, and pants were offered in each primary color along with a matching jacket. Either a harlequin-patterned body blouse with collar, or a polka dot-patterned body blouse nicknamed the “Wonder Bread” with an attached pussycat bow, could be paired with any combination. Striped-sleeve, mock-turtleneck, sweater bodysuits also came in all three primary colors.   “Flight Patterns” is on display post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at:  http://bit.ly/FlightPatternsSFOM",
