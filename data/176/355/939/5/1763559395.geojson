        "body": "Artist Stacy Speyer began making this series of geometric metal sculptures as an artist-in-residence at the Exploratorium. The Greek term combines ‘poly’ meaning many and ‘hedra’ for faces or sides; hence, polyhedra are three-dimensional shapes made of polygon faces joined at the edges and corners. Speyer created these three polyhedra—a dodecahedron, a hexahedron, and a rhombic triacontahedron, by bending the corners (vertices), bolting them to the edges of each polyhedron, and leaving the faces open.
