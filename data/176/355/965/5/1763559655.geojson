        "body": "In 1972, Emilio Pucci (1914–92) designed the “727 Braniff Place Blue Pant Collection” to commemorate the company’s growing fleet of Boeing 727 trijet airliners. A blue, short-sleeve dress made from lightweight Qiana nylon was offered in square- or high-neck options, with a scoop neck for the sleeveless dress. Likely influenced by Braniff’s routes to Latin America and the region’s traditional women’s wear, 727 Braniff Place featured patterned skirts with decorative borders and two different hemlines that were worn with shorts or palazzo pants. Matching pumps, an umbrella, purse, and a reversible coat completed the ensemble.   \"Flight Patterns\" is on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: http://bit.ly/FlightPatternsSFOM",
