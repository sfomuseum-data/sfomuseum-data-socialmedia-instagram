        "body": "#Onthisday in 1889 Lockheed Aircraft Corporation founder Allan Lockheed was born in Fremont, California. Born Allan Haines Loughead, he formed the Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company with his older brother, Malcolm Loughead, in 1912. In 1915, the brothers opened a flying concession at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, selling rides on their Model G aircraft.  After changing his last name to Lockheed (the phonetic spelling of Loughead), Allen formed the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation with Jack Northrop in 1926 and began developing the highly successful Vega. After going into receivership in 1932, a group of investors bought it and formed the Lockheed Aircraft Company. In 1995, Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta to form the Lockheed Martin Company.",
