Lipofsky worked in China with glassmaster Wong Cheung Yun in 1996 and returned three years later to start a second series with Yun. The project was arranged by Lipofskyâ€™s longtime friend, Swedish glassworker and international technical consultant Willy Andersson, and conducted at the renowned Dalian Shengdao Glassware Factory in northeastern China.   \"Marvin Lipofsky: International Studio Glass\" is on view pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/MarvinLipofsky",
