For almost 30 years, the bridgeâ€™s main span held the title of the longest suspension bridge in the world. This monumental project started #onthisday in 1933 and finished in 1937. Did you know that the Golden Gate Bridge is not named for its orange color but for the strait it crosses, the Golden Gate strait? The bridge is painted in \"International Orange\" color to provide enhanced visibility for passing ships. Have you visited this popular tourist destination?",
