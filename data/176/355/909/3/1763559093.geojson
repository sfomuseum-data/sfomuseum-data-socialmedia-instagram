        "body": "Century Pacific Air Lines was one of the early commercial airline companies to operate at Mills Field. In May of 1931, the company announced it would start service on the West Coast, and San Francisco was selected as its main base of operations. While the company was short lived - it was taken over by American Airways (later American Airlines) in April 1932 and ceased operations in San Francisco the following month - it was a major tenant for Mills Field, carrying just over 10,000 passengers along its route between June and September of 1931.",
