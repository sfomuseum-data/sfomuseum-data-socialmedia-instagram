From the euphoria and heartache of a teen’s first love to a pair of competitive dancers who challenge established conventions, and from the brave voices of those who defy governmental and societal persecution to a meditation on the power of a father’s affirmation, today’s filmmakers bring us stories from the LGBTQ community that reflect the importance of living one’s life with courage and authenticity.  Our screening room may still be closed, but you can watch the films online at: http://bit.ly/VideoArts \u003c--or navigate here via the link in our bio.",
