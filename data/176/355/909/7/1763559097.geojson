By inscribing his pottery with poetry and signing his name, the enslaved potter known as Dave engaged in an exceptional act of resistance. Learn more about the life and work of David Drake, the surname he took upon emancipation, in our most recent exhibition, Stoneware Stories.  Juneteenth, a holiday celebrated - and now officially recognized as a federal holiday - nationally on June 19th, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. In recognition of this historic day and all that it means for our country to continue the fight for equality, San Francisco's annual Juneteenth celebrations honor the achievements and determination of the African-American community with a festival and parade along Fillmore Street, where the first San Francisco Juneteenth celebration was held in 1950. The event usually draws some 75,000 people to the Fillmore District for the parade, a classic car show, a traditional African Uhuru village, and other activities. This year, however, due to COVID-19, smaller in-person and virtual experiences are planned. To learn more about these events, please visit https://www.sftravel.com/article/celebrate-juneteenth-san-francisco-way  On Saturday night, @flysfo will be lighting our International Terminal in red, black and green in celebration.  “Stoneware Stories: Folk Pottery of Edgefield, South Carolina” is on view pre-security in the International Terminal, and online at: https://bit.ly/StonewareStories \u003c— link in bio",
