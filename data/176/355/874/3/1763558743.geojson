        "body": "Crystal sets received radio signals during the earliest days of broadcasting. These simple radios did not operate from batteries or household current-they relied on a semi-conductive mineral known as a crystal and simple circuitry to harness energy directly from radio waves in the air. Crystal sets required a large antenna and a good ground connection to be effective. Due to their low output, crystal sets could not power speakers and listeners wore headsets.  Radio Bug courtesy of Steve Kushman \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
