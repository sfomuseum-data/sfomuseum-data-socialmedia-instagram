        "body": "Henry Segerman (@henryseg) is a professor of mathematics at Oklahoma State University. His research interests include three-dimensional geometry and topology, and mathematical art and visualization. In visualization, he works mostly in the medium of 3D printing. His book, “Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing” (2016) reflects his passion for the field. Segerman’s YouTube channel features a variety of videos that illustrate different mathematical concepts in an effort to make math more accessible and engaging. Visit his YouTube Channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/henryseg  Henry visited our exhibition recently and posed for a portrait with his featured work!
