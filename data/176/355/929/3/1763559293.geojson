        "body": "#Onthisday in 1953, American Airlines introduced the DC-7 as its first non-stop, transcontinental airliner. The DC-7 was Douglas Aircraftâ€™s last piston-powered, four-engine airliner before the introduction of jet turbofan engines. The first flight departed from New York bound for Los Angeles and made American the first carrier to offer non-stop transcontinental flights within the United States   The DC-7 cruised at 360 miles per hour, making it the fastest transport aircraft in service, at the time. However, sales of the DC-7 rapidly declined by the end of the decade, with the arrival of long-range jets such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8.",
