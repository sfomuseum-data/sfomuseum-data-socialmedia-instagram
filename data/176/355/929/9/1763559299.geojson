        "body": "The A350 is Airbus’ most recent long-range, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner. Designed to replace the four-engine A340 and compete with the Boeing 777 and 787, the A350 makes extensive use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer to boost range and efficiency. The A350 features distinctive curved wingtips which are 15 feet tall. Traveling at a cruising speed of Mach 0.85, the A350 has a range of 9,700 nautical miles. The A350-900 variant can carry up to 350 passengers in three-class configuration, while the longer A350-1000 can be fitted to carry over 400. Introduced with Qatar Airways in 2015, Singapore Airlines is now the largest operator of A350s. Have you ever flown on an A350?",
