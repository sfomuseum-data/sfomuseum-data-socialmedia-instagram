        "body": "William Burges (1827–81), a nineteenth-century British architect, interior designer, and furniture designer, emerged as an eccentric proponent of the Gothic Revival in mid-nineteenth-century Britain. Completely enamored by the medieval aesthetic, he created fanciful buildings with lavishly decorated interiors. He also drew inspiration from Turkey and traveled extensively throughout Europe. Burges restored and redesigned Cardiff Castle in Wales and nearby Castell Coch.   From 1875–80, he designed his own home, the Tower House in London, in the Gothic Revival style. Burges incorporated figurative scenes in his heavily ornamented designs, conjuring myths, medieval romances, and animal fables. Burges preferred wall paintings to wallpaper; nevertheless, he designed several papers, frequently depicting lively animals, such as the squirrels illustrated in the wallpaper frieze shown here. Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers’ High Victorian Gothic room set draws its inspiration from Burges’ imaginative medievalism.  Special thank you to Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers for making this exhibition possible. “The Victorian Papered Wall” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/VictorianPaperedWall",
