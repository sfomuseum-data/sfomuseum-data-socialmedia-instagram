        "body": "#Onthisday in 1940, Vito Acconci was born in New York City’s Bronx borough. Acconci began his artistic career as a poet and came to national prominence in the early 1970s as an artist working in performance and conceptual art. Acconci’s work is often characterized by a direct involvement of the viewer as an element in the artwork. Along this corridor, sculptural beams of light splay out from the recessed lighting in the ceiling above and transverse the length of the corridor, like rays of light. At the end of each “light beam” is a functional telephone.  See “Light Beams for the Sky of a Transfer Corridor” by Vito Acconci, located, pre-security, on the departures level of the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/3HXcBNS",
