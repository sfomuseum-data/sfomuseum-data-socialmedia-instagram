Established in 1940, it is a day encouraging citizens from North, Central, and South America to increase their interest in aviation and commemorating the Wright Brother’s first sustained flight of a controlled, powered, heavier-than-air aircraft. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt honored the Wright brothers’ early achievement by issuing a proclamation designating December 17th as Pan American Aviation Day.
