        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1974, the Aérospatiale/British Aircraft Corporation Concorde supersonic transport (SST) landed at SFO. This brief visit was part of a promotional tour to airports around the world. The Concorde, primarily operated by British Airways and Air France, could travel at Mach 2.04 or 1,350 miles per hour, faster than the speed of the Earth's rotation. The inaugural Air France flight from Paris to Washington, DC on May 24, 1976, took 3 hours and 50 minutes, and a ticket cost about $8,000 in today's currency. Comparatively, a turbofan jet engine powered direct flight from Paris to Washington takes about 8 hours. The Concorde was in service between 1976 and 2003. Did you ever fly on a Concorde?",
