Give a strip of paper a half-twist and tape the ends together— you get a Möbius loop, a one-sided shape with one edge. Make two Möbius loops and glue their edges together—you should get a Klein bottle. But this is impossible in our universe—you need four spatial dimensions! In our 3-D universe, every Klein bottle must have a self-intersection, where tubing crosses through a wall.
