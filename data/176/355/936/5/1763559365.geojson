        "body": "The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 incorporated many design features of the DC-10 such as the trijet configuration, but also deviated as it featured a stretched fuselage, increased wingspan, a redesigned wing trailing edge, and a glass cockpit. Seating capacities varied from 285 in a three-class arrangement to 410 in an all-economy configuration. The medium- to long-range widebody aircraft had a range 7,000 to 10,000 miles and had a cruising speed of 588 mph. Introduced by Finnair on December 20, 1990, it is currently only used as a cargo aircraft. MD-11 production ended in 2000 after 200 airframes were built.",
