        "body": "Shortly after arriving in Edgefield, South Carolina, Thomas Chandler mastered the use of local kaolin clay and alkaline glazes, creating beautiful pots that exhibited a celadon-like gloss surface similar to those produced in China and Korea. Chandler most likely incorporated a large quantity of silica and lime in his glaze formula to create these now-famous wares. Chandlerâ€™s pale green glaze resulted from small amounts of iron oxide in the glaze combined with the pots being fired in a reduced kiln atmosphere in which the kiln is deprived of oxygen.  #StonewareStories: Folk Pottery of Edgefield, South Carolina is on display pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall, near the security checkpoint for the A gates and online at: http://bit.ly/StonewareStories",
