        "body": "Congratulations to Woody De Othello for his forthcoming participation in the 2022 Whitney Biennial! SFO and the San Francisco Arts Commission are proud to be the location and sponsor of his first public art pieces, which are located in the Airportâ€™s International Terminal. After applying for the sculpture opportunity at SFO, he was selected and created three medium size sculptures for International Terminal Boarding Area G. His first time working in bronze, \"Time, Turn, and Light\" depict ambiguous sets of hands interacting with everyday objects such as clocks, a flashlight, a candle, and a doorknob. These objects are rendered in an uncanny fashion with a sense of play, emotional intuition, and surrealism that provokes viewers to reimagine themselves and the way they see the world around them.   See \"Time, Turn, and Light\" by Woody De Othello, on display, post-security, in the Outdoor Terrace Observation Deck on the departures level of the International Terminal G Concourse. https://bit.ly/3kiuVFq",
