        "body": "#Onthisday in 1964, Eastern Air Lines first introduced the Boeing 727. The aircraft was a medium range, intermediate-capacity jetliner that could serve regional airports with short runways. It featured a clean swept wing, a high horizontal stabilizer, and a unique tri-jet configuration, which was influenced by the Hawker Siddeley Trident. This design dictated that the horizontal stabilizer be placed well away from the middle engine, high on top of the vertical stabilizer.   The only tri-jet to be developed by Boeing, the 727 was the result of a request from Eastern Air Lines, United Air Lines, and American Airlines for a medium-range airliner with less capacity than both the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 that could serve smaller regional airports with short runways. At the aft underbelly was a uniquely located passenger door and air stair that allowed passengers to exit from the back of the aircraft.",
