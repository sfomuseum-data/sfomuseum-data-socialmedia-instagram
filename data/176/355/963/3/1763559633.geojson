        "body": "Ansett Airways was founded in 1935 by Sir Reginald Myles \"Reg\" Ansett in Australia. Service between Hamilton and Melbourne was inaugurated in 1936 with a Fokker F XI Universal monoplane. By the late 1930s, the airline was flying the swift Lockheed L10A Electra. Following World War II, Ansett acquired war-surplus C-47s and converted them to passenger carrying DC-3s. It continued operating as a low-price domestic airline during the early 1950s. In 1957, Ansett acquired its major competitor ANA (Australian National Airways) and assumed the name Ansett-ANA.   Over the next three decades, the carrier operated domestic routes in competition with TAA (Trans-Australia Airlines). In 1964, Ansett-ANA received delivery of its first pure turbojet, the Boeing 727. The airline introduced a new corporate look in 1968 with bright reddish-orange liveries and a stylized “A” logo, while dropping “ANA” from its name. Several chic cabin crew uniforms were introduced during the 1970s that incorporated this orange palette. Over-expansion into international markets eventually led to Ansett’s financial demise in 2001. Shortly after, a brief effort to revive the airline with limited services was unsuccessful, and in March 2002, the airline ceased operations.",
