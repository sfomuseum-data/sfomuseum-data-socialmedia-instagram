        "body": "The Sikorsky S-40 was developed in response to requests from Pan American Airways’ president Juan T. Trippe for a high-capacity flying boat. With a cabin capable of carrying thirty-eight passengers, it was nearly double the capacity of the Consolidated Commodore, the airline’s next largest flying boat. Only three were built, and these were the first to be named “Clipper Ships.” The cabins were spacious and luxuriously appointed with mahogany paneling. Pan American Airways introduced the aircraft in 1931, piloted by Charles A. Lindbergh on its Miami–Barranquilla route. Although the aircraft served the airline well through the 1930s without incident, it was often derided for its lack of aerodynamic efficiency due to its many struts and support wires. Lindbergh famously referred to the aircraft as a “flying forest.”  Photographs, c. 1931 (1) Gift of M. D. Klaas, 2018.112.0325 (2) Gift of Jon E.
