        "body": "The all-metal, twin-engine Boeing 247 was a revolutionary airliner when it entered into service with United AIr Lines in 1933. Often referred to as the first modern airliner, it featured numerous advancements including all-aluminum, semi-monocoque construction, wing flaps, autopilot, and semi-retractable landing gear. Seventy-five of the aircraft were eventually built, with most going to the United Air Linesâ€™ fleet and operating on its \"Mainline\" transcontinental route.  Although advanced for its time, the Model 247 accommodated only ten passengers, which made it less economical to operate than larger capacity airliners, particularly the more fuel-efficient, fourteen-seat Douglas DC-2, introduced a year later.",
