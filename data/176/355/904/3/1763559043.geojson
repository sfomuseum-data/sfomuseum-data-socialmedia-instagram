Our workshops and storage aren’t in the terminals, so we must prepare objects for the short journey from our building to the airport terminal. Here our registrars pack this slide rule into a foam-lined tray using foam blocks and sheets, tissue paper, and metal pins – which are all saved and reused for other packing jobs.  Stay tuned for more behind the scenes content from SFO Museum!",
