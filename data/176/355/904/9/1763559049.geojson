        "body": "In 1968, United Air Lines introduced their first uniform designed by Oscar-winning Hollywood costumer Jean Louis (1907–97), who had worked with such stars as Rita Hayworth (1918–87), Lana Turner (1921–95), and Marilyn Monroe (1926–62). The youthful A-line dress was offered in four color combinations: Hawaiian Sunset or Maliblue with a Miami Sands stripe, or in the optional ivory-colored Miami Sands with an orange Hawaiian Sunset or dark blue Maliblue stripe. Each dress came in two hemline length options. Typical was tailored at the knee, while Tiny sat above the knee and was reminiscent of the shift dresses made famous by London-based designer Mary Quant (b. 1930) and the Mod fashion scene. Matching kepi hats, full-length wool coats, and a tri-color skimmer dress for in-flight service rounded out the uniform.   \"Flight Patterns\" is on display in a brand new gallery located post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/FlightPatternsSFOM",
