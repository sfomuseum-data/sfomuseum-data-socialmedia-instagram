        "body": "The DC-9 was designed by Douglas as a mid-range jetliner with a smaller capacity than the Boeing 727 and with the ability to serve the short runways of small regional airports. Similar to the Sud Aviation Caravelle, it featured two jet engines mounted at the rear of the fuselage and a high-mounted horizontal stabilizer. The DC-9 and its many variants were highly successful for numerous airlines worldwide. The aircraft was produced for 41 years, first by Douglas, then McDonnell Douglas, and finally Boeing in numerous variants and derivatives, with final deliveries of its last derivative, the Boeing 717, in 2006.  San Francisco based Hughes Airwest operated a large McDonnell Douglas DC-9 fleet, which were ideal for its West Coast routes and the many regional airports it served. Painted in bright Sundance Yellow, the airline caricatured its DC-9 aircraft as flying bananas and advertised itself as the “Top banana in the West” in its advertisements and company materials. The campaign was highly successful and created widespread brand recognition.",
