In the 1960s, the airport's previous hotel featured 380 rooms and a night club favored by airline staff and locals called the Tiger A Go-Go. The San Francisco Airport Hilton was the first of the Hilton chain to be located at an airport. It was demolished in the 1990s to make way for the International Terminal. Do you remember the old airport hotel?  Image: San Francisco International Airport (SFO), aerial, Hilton Hotel, 1962. SFO Museum Collection. 2011.032.0740",
