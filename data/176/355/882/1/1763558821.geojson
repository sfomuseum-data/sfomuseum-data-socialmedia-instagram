        "body": "Happy 100th Birthday KLM! #Onthisday in 1919, #KLM (Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V., or KLM Royal Dutch Airlines) was founded. The company is the oldest airline in the world still operating under its original name. On May 17, 1920, KLM operated its first flight, which was from London to Amsterdam. Now, KLM services over 145 destinations worldwide. A #funfact about KLM and its sister company, Air France, with which it merged in 2004: Air France was coincidentally founded on this same day in 1933 and the two airlines share the same birthday! Have you ever flown on KLM?  Image: KLM (Royal Dutch Airlines) postcard, Boeing 747B, DC-8-63, Douglas DC-8, Douglas DC-9, 1970s. Gift of Thomas G. Dragges. 2015.166.2537",
