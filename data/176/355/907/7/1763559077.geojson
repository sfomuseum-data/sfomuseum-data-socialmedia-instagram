        "body": "The Lockheed L-188 Electra was the only large turboprop airliner produced in the United States. The design originated in the mid-1950s with a request from American Airlines for a fast, mid-range, high-capacity airliner. The aircraft featured a relatively short-span, low-mounted, cantilevered wing with four Allison turboprop engines. The prototype flew in 1957, and the next year initial deliveries went to American and Eastern Airlines. Eastern was the first to inaugurate service in January 1959. The regional airline PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines), based in San Diego, purchased three of the aircraft, which proved ideal for the carrierâ€™s West Coast routes.   The Electra was introduced to great enthusiasm, but over the next several years, a major engine-mount design flaw was discovered. Although the defect was remedied, the airliner never regained the confidence of the public or major carriers. With the introduction of faster mid-range turbojets, the Electra was primarily relegated to regional airlines and cargo carriers. One of its current uses today is as a large capacity (or \"heavy\") air tanker used in the control of wildfires.",
