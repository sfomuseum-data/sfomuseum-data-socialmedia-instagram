        "body": "In his 2018 series \"Ice Fishers,\" Aleksey Kondratyev draws focus on the Kazakh men who fish through the ice of the frozen Ishim River. The Ishim flows through Astana (now Nur-Sultan) a high-rise, futuristic city that was named Kazakhstan’s capital in the late-1990s. The capital is located in one of the coldest populated regions on Earth and the fishers frequently brave subzero temperatures on the river. Working in the elements for extended periods of time, they often utilize the protection of plastic packaging obtained from nearby markets selling Western, Chinese, and Russian goods. Bright and sculptural, these temporary barriers stand in contrast to the stark landscape, highlighting their occupants’ activities and illuminating the influence of global capitalism on the region’s local, nomadic practices.   \"Aleksey Kondratyev: Ice Fishers\" is on view pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/IceFishers  #AlekseyKondratyev #IceFishers #Kazakhstan #photography #photographer",
