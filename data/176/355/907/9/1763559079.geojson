Designed by Dalton Apparel, it featured a short-sleeve, ivory dress with a lime green, brown, and navy, plaid-patterned skirt and necktie. Three jackets in lime green, brown, or navy were paired with the dress, allowing for a mix-and-match styling, along with a matching vinyl belt.   \"Flight Patterns\" is on display in a brand new gallery located post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1, as well as online \u003c-- See link in bio.",
