        "body": "The Concorde SST (supersonic transport) was the first successful transoceanic supersonic airliner—although the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 was the first supersonic airliner to be introduced. Developed as a joint endeavor between the governments of Great Britain and France, on January 21, 1976, Air France launched Concorde service between Paris and Rio de Janeiro, and British Airways introduced Concorde service on its London to Bahrain route. The service aboard the British Airways Concorde was all one class: Concorde Class. Considered comparable or a step above most airlines’ first-class services, it included premium spirits and gourmet meals created by world-renowned chiefs, served on dishes designed specifically for the Concorde. The aircraft seated one hundred in specially designed seats arranged in twenty-five rows of four seats placed two by two. Flying onboard the Concorde was comfortable, smooth, and quiet—the result of flying well ahead of the incredible noise created by its powerful turbojet engines—and an experience passengers remembered for a lifetime. All Concorde SSTs were retired in 2003.",
