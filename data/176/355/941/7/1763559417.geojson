This photo, taken by Daniel Nicoletta the day after the White Night Riots on May 21, 1979, was a prescient forecast of Milk’s enduring legacy. The first openly gay elected official in California, Harvey Milk’s legacy does indeed live on in the Terminal named after him at SFO and our exhibition “Harvey Milk: Messenger of Hope”. Our two-part exhibition, located both pre- and post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1, “Harvey Milk: Messenger of Hope” features photographs, letters, speech drafts, and other campaign materials celebrating Harvey Milk’s life.
