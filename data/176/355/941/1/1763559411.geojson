        "body": "The 767 was the first two-engine widebody airliner produced by Boeing. It was designed to be a smaller widebody airliner than the 747, with a capacity between two-hundred and three-hundred passengers and the range for most transoceanic routes. It also featured a “glass cockpit,” or all-digital LCD flight instrument display panels, and could be operated by two pilots. It took off on its maiden flight on September 26, 1981, and it was introduced into service with United Airlines a year later on September 8, 1982. In production for forty years, over 1,200 of the aircraft have been built.  During the 1980s, Qantas Airlines purchased six of the Boeing 767-200ER (ER for extra range), and forty-one of the 767-300ER, which proved ideal for the carrier’s expansion into the Asian market, where the 747 was too large for customer demand. To commemorate the event, the airline introduced a new corporate look, a fresh livery for the aircraft, and a new line of cabin and ground crew uniforms. These spacious, comfortable, widebody airliners proved reliable and economical to operate for Qantas over the next two decades.",
