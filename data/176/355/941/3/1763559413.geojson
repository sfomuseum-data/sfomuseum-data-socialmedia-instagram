        "body": "By September 21, 1927, Hangar No. 1 at Mills Field was completed. The airport's first hangar was made of steel framing with galvanized-corrugated iron siding. Navigational aids on the hangar included a 24-inch revolving beacon, an illuminated wind cone, and 11-foot high lettering identifying the airfield. Part of this hangar is now on display in our exhibition “Mills Field and the San Francisco Airport” located pre-security, in the Observation Deck in Terminal 2. https://bit.ly/MillsFieldSFO",
