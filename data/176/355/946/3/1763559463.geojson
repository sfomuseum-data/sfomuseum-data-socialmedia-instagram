On May 2, 1915, with mother Avis in the sidecar of a new Harley-Davidson 11-F, they departed Brooklyn, New York, for San Francisco to see the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. Effie and Avis Hotchkiss returned to New York two months later after a remarkable 9,000-mile journey.  “Early American Motorcycles” is on view pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall and online - link in bio. https://bit.ly/EarlyMotorcycles",
