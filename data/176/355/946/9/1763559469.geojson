The world just lost an incredible artist and an more impressive human being. #HungLiu, born in China in 1948, settled in the Bay Area in the 1980s. Her signature painterly style was one that allowed the paint to drip across the image and strongly influenced by ancient Chinese art.  She was 73. Our thoughts and our prayers are with her friends and family.  Celebrate her life with her art at SFO. See her #painting \"Take Off\" on display post-security in the International Terminal A side or online at: https://bit.ly/3Asz8yh",
