        "body": "New exhibition alert! Marvin Lipofsky (1938–2016) was a founding member of the American studio glass movement. Throughout his career, Lipofsky explored the limits of form and color in glass and helped to elevate the medium to a fine art. Lipofsky’s most prolific work focused on glass sculpture that was initiated in a collaborative setting, such as a factory or workshop, and then finished in his Berkeley, California studio. For close to five decades, Lipofsky worked in glass factories and workshops all over the world, earning him the title of the \"roving ambassador of glass.” This exhibition explores sculpture made by Lipofsky in eight different countries, from 1972 through 2006.  \"Marvin Lipofsky: International Studio Glass\" is on view pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/MarvinLipofsky",
