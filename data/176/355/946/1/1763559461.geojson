        "body": "The first wide-body jumbo-jet to be introduced, the Boeing 747 revolutionized long-distance, transoceanic commercial aviation and set the standard for all other wide-body designs that followed. The 747 was one of the first airliners to be powered by highly-efficient, high-bypass turbofan engines, four of which could thrust the aircraft to a cruising speed of 550 miles an hour. The massive fuselage incorporated a small upper deck, and a lower, main cabin, which was wide enough to seat ten passengers across with two aisles. Pan American World Airways introduced the 747-100 series in January 1970 on the transatlantic New York to London route. Numerous other major airlines received deliveries and launched service soon after, but Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways waited for the extended-range 747-200 and received its first delivery in 1979. With a range of nearly 7,000 miles, the new aircraft were capable of providing nonstop service on most transoceanic routes. By the mid-1980s, Cathay Pacific also operated the lengthened upper-cabin, 496-passenger-capacity, 747-300 series with service to Europe and North America.",
