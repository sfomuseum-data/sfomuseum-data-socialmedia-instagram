        "body": "In 1970, Marvin Lipofsky was invited to Italy by Ludovico Diaz de Santillana, director of the Venini Glass Factory on the island of Murano. Two years later, Lipofsky accepted and began his first Venini Series with master glassmaker Gianni Toso (b. 1942). Using molds and colors available at the Venini factory, Lipofsky and Toso created exciting new forms by blowing glass into the wooden molds as they were rotated by hand. Lipofsky returned to Murano in 1976 and worked with Toso again, this time at the Fratelli-Toso Factory where they experimented with variations on brightly colored cane work, which is a traditional type of Italian striping decoration.   \"Marvin Lipofsky: International Studio Glass\" is on view pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/MarvinLipofsky",
