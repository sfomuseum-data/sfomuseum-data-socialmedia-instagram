The preliminary designs of the 757 retained the cockpit layout and T-tail configuration of the 727, however as development progressed, the 757's electromechanical cockpit was upgraded with computerized cathode-ray tube color displays and the T-tail was scrapped for a conventional tail to allow for increased passenger capacity. The 757-200, the first variant produced, carried up to 228 passengers and had a range of approximately 3,900 nautical miles (7222 kilometers). Eastern Air Lines was the first to take delivery of the 757s in December 1982. The last 757 was produced in 2004, though they are still in service around the world.",
