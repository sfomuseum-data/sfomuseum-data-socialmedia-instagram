        "body": "Martyn Pugh is a designer-silversmith who is known for creating modern forms with graceful and flowing lines. Pugh’s silverwork reflects his belief that “function and mechanics are of equal importance to uncompromised beauty.” The elegant vessels of Pugh’s Linear Design coffee service successfully demonstrate the artist’s intention to design sculptural forms with practical applications and reflect his desire for lines that “appear to travel on invisibly to infinity.” The streamlined pot features an insulated handle and a flush hinge to operate the lid. The interiors of both the milk jug and the sugar bowl are gilded.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal",
