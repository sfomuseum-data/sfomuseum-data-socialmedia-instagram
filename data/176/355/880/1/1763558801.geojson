The rubboard is a rhythm instrument made from a corrugated steel board. Although he was not the first to play a rubboard, his younger brother Clifton was the first to design this instrument to fit like a vest over his chest, a style which came to be emulated by other zydeco musicians who followed after him. Cleveland, considered the most innovative and accomplished rubboard player, beat and scraped the instrument with bottle openers—six on each hand—to create varied sounds. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
