        "body": "Happy Birthday, Ralph Lauren! Born #onthisday in New York City in 1939, the iconic American fashion designer began his career as a glove salesman for Brooks Brothers.  This 1978 TWA (Trans World Airlines) uniform by American fashion icon Ralph Lauren, signaled a turn toward nostalgic romanticism in airline uniform design. The conservative traditionalism of the double-breasted navy blue wool jacket and a longer skirt harkens back to the military and more masculine suits of the 1930s. Ruby cuff ranks and stars on the sleeve mix with the Ivy League look of the oxford shirt, collar bar, and rep tie.",
