        "body": "Over SFO’s 94 years in operation, the airport has changed dramatically. SFO Museum’s exhibition detailing the airport’s rapid development, from cow pasture to one of the busiest airports in the United States, is on display in the Sky Terrace.   The history of San Francisco International Airport parallels the development of commercial aviation in the United States. From daring pilots who flew the mail in open-cockpit biplanes to double-decker jet airliners that safely shuttle hundreds of passengers thousands of miles away, SFO has witnessed great strides in aviation. For close to a century, the airport reinvented itself numerous times.   Looking out over the busy runways and terminals today, one can only imagine the lonely stretch of pastureland that predated SFO. See “Mills Field and the San Francisco Airport” on display in the Sky Terrace. Sky Terrace is open Friday through Monday pre-security in Terminal 2. https://bit.ly/MillsFieldSFO",
