This was the place where they had the symposium exhibition and so forth with all the flags from the various countries there. I am trying to give you a feeling for the experience that I had. I just can’t believe that I did all this stuff.\" —Marvin Lipofsky; Glass Art Society, 2009  Marvin Lipofsky (1938–2016) was a founding member of the American studio glass movement. For close to five decades, he worked in glass factories and workshops all over the world, earning him the title of the “roving ambassador of glass.”  See \"Marvin Lipofsky: International Studio Glass\" on view pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/MarvinLipofsky",
