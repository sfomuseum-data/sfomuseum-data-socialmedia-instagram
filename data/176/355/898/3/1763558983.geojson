        "body": "On November 22, 1935, the inaugural Pan American Airways Clipper transpacific airmail service departed from California to Manila, the Philippines, carrying 110,865 letters. The Martin M-130 flying boat “China Clipper” lifted off from the waters of San Francisco Bay and strained into the sky threading its way under and over the Bay’s now iconic bridges, which were only partially built at that time. It soared through the Golden Gate and slowly disappeared from land as the airplane and its crew of seven opened the age of scheduled transpacific commercial air service. The flight covered 8,210 miles with a flying time of 59 hours and 48 minutes.   Our exhibition detailing the entire adventurous endeavor, \"China Clipper\", is online at: http://bit.ly/chinaclipper You can also read the entire exhibition catalog and watch all three segments of “Clipper Glory” there!
