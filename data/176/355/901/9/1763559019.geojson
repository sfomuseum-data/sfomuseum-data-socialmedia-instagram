Rojas intends to bring a sense of warmth and comfort to the viewer, and she often changes the exhibition space to better fit the feeling of her work. Here, she transforms the wall in the International Terminal G91 gate room into space more reminiscent of home. Blue Deer is based on a children’s book Rojas wrote and illustrated, “Blue Deer and Red Fox”.  “Blue Deer” by #ClareRojas is online at: https://bit.ly/2F3MPwF",
