        "body": "#Onthisday in 1958, the first scheduled Pan American World Airways jet service took off from Idlewild, New York. Flying to Paris, Pan Am carried 111 passengers across the Atlantic. The 707 was developed by Boeing as the result of an initial 1955 request from Pan American for a large jet-powered airliner. The jetâ€™s greater speed and higher passenger capacity enabled the airlines to substantially reduce their seat-mile costs, and thus lower ticket prices opening up air travel to a large percentage of the public. Have you ever flown on a Boeing 707?  Image: Pan American World Airways, Pacific-Alaska Division [digital scan], 1958. Gift of William E. Talbott. 2012.151.356",
