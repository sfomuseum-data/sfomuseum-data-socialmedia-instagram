Born #onthiday in Paris in 1913, the fashion designer worked in New York and Hollywood during an illustrious career that famously included being First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy’s official designer. In 1955, he introduced a fitted suit for TWA hostesses that was issued for five years. In a medium brown wool for winter, this summer version in lightweight green wool has a collarless jacket and belted skirt. The embroidered lettering was repeated on the cotton blouse. The colors were coordinated with the cabin interiors of the airline’s Lockheed Constellation for trans-Atlantic service at the height of the propliner era.",
