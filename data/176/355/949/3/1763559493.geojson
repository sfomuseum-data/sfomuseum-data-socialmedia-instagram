        "body": "Happy Birthday, Bob Zoell! The artist, born on this day in 1940, completed this work of public art in the connector between Terminal 3 and the International Terminal in 2009. “I’ve always been attracted and fascinated by birds and their freedom through flight,” says Bob Zoell. Combining his lifelong passion for language and birds, the artist created a playful world of singing birds sitting on branches composed from letters and punctuation marks. The top and bottom frosted glass panels feature airplanes and typography, rendered in a simplified graphic style. Together, these images create a code of abstract icons intended to delight visitors of all ages.
