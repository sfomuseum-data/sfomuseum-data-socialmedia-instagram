        "body": "A Möbius band is a ribbon that closes upon itself after making an odd number of 180-degree flips. It is also single-sided; a snail could move to the “other side” on the ribbon without ever having to cross a sharp border. Here, on “Aurora Australis,” the Möbius band follows the surface of an unseen sphere. The wavy pattern and luminous color of the ribbon takes its inspiration from the auroras that can be observed in the sky near the two poles of the earth.  Carlo Séquin has served as a professor in the Computer Science Division at UC Berkeley since 1977. He looks for underlying mathematical structures in the abstract geometrical sculptures of other artists. He then slightly modifies these structures and produces novel, complex forms. Alternatively, he may start with a geometrical model that tries to explain a mathematical concept. He then develops and refines the model until it acquires an attractive presence as a sculpture independent of the mathematical ideas behind it. The geometric shapes of this sculpture were generated on a 3D printer and then cast in bronze by Steve Reinmuth in his studio in Eugene, Oregon.
