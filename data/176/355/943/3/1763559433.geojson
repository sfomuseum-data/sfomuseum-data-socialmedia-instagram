        "body": "Joseph Frederic Merkel (1872–1978) road-tested his first motorcycle in 1900. Like many early manufacturers, Merkel based his initial design on a small engine attached to a bicycle-like frame with a simple belt-drive to the rear wheel. The Merkel Manufacturing Company of Milwaukee commenced production of an improved model in 1902, and Merkel introduced a stronger loop-type frame with an innovative rear suspension the following year. After he patented a telescoping-fork, spring-loaded front suspension, Merkel merged his company in 1908 with another motorcycle maker, the Light Manufacturing and Foundry Company of Pottstown, Pennsylvania.    The new Merkel-Light proved successful on the racetrack, and “The Flying Merkel” brand-name was given to their racing machines and applied to all street-going motorcycles. Joseph Merkel continued his tenure as chief engineer and designer when Merkel-Light was purchased by The Miami Cycle \u0026 Manufacturing Company in 1911. Working from a new three-story factory in Middletown, Ohio, the company manufactured a powerful twin-cylinder, chain-driven Flying Merkel in 1912. Five new models were available in 1913. They featured redesigned single- and twin-cylinder engines supported internally by ball bearings, along with wider forks, larger tires, and rear mono-shock suspensions similar to those found on modern motorcycles. This 1914 Flying Merkel is equipped with a seven-horsepower twin-cylinder engine, v-belt drive, and optional speedometer driven by the front wheel.   “Early American Motorcycles” is on view pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall and online - link in bio. https://bit.ly/EarlyMotorcycles",
