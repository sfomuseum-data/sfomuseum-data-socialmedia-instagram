From a teenager who documents her aspirations while living in Jordan’s Azraq Refugee Camp to the expressions of frustration and strength from transgender schoolchildren, and from an animated tribute to a young boy’s imagination to a “coming of age” story of self-acceptance, today’s filmmakers bring us stories that inspire and enlighten.  The Video Arts screening room temporarily is closed to the public at this time. In the meantime, our virtual screening room remains open while we present themed programming from our archives. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Museum’s screening room again soon. http://bit.ly/VideoArts",
