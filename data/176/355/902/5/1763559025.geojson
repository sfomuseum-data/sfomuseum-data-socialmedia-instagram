Barbershops and hair salons may consist of a simple structure with a hand-painted sign nailed to its exterior. These signs are painted on wood or particle board by self-taught sign artists who work in studios or independently. Our exhibition displays a variety of colorful signs from the past forty years from West Africa and Kenya, where barbershops are called kinyozi. What is your favorite sign?   See “Extra ’O’!” African Barbershop and Hairdressing Signs” online at: http://bit.ly/Extrao",
