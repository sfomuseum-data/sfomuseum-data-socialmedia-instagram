In 1995, we presented “Tins” which celebrated the creative use of offset lithography as a means of decorating the humble tin container. The mass production tin cans in the early 1900s revolutionized the ability to store and transport preserved foods. Far more reliable than paper, printing designs directly onto tin made for a lasting decorative item, and designers sought to attract buyers to the package, not just to the product within. Do you remember this exhibition?",
