        "body": "The Boeing 377 Stratocruiser was considered the most luxurious airliner aloft when introduced by Pan American World Airways in 1949. Its unique, pressurized, “double-bubble” fuselage was equipped with two decks: the upper contained a roomy main cabin, while the lower featured the highly popular cocktail lounge. And with nineteen windowpanes, the cockpit offered one of the highest degrees of visibility of any airliner.  The aircraft’s four 28-cylinder Pratt \u0026 Whitney radial engines enabled the Stratocruiser, as its name asserted, to cruise in the stratosphere at over 300 miles per hour. With a range of just over 4,000 miles, the airliner was ideally suited for transoceanic routes. Pan American World Airways launched Stratocruiser transpacific service from San Francisco to Hawai’i in April 1949, and transatlantic service to London in June 1949 as all first-class “President” service.",
