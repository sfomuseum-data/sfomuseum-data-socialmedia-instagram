        "body": "Preeminent French couturier Pierre Balmain was born #OnThisDay in 1914. He was highly successful at translating Parisian styles into ready-to-wear collections, and among his creations were sophisticated and elegant uniforms for TWA (Trans World Airlines) and Cathay Pacific Airways. His 1965 summer uniform for TWA's 2,400 hostesses, was created from fabric mill-dyed to specification for the turquoise and white color scheme. And in 1974, he dressed Cathay Pacific's flight attendants in an outfit called the Tung Hoi (Eastern Sea) uniform, which was issued until 1983.",
