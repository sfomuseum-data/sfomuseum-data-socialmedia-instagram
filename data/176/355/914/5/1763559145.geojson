        "body": "Sporting masks and matching uniforms, The Phantom Surfers channeled the look and sound of a first wave surf group when they hit the stage and studio with their “California Go!” sound in San Francisco in the late 1980s. In 1992, guitarist Mel Bergman created his own double-neck guitar for the band. Affectionately known as “DoubleJunk,” the unique guitar incorporated hardware and electrical components from a 1980s Fender Jaguar and 1960s Japanese Jazzmaster copy. These donor parts were fitted to a body, pickguard, and necks crafted by Bergman from scratch.  For more about this exhibition and surf music, listen to @kfjc897fm on Saturday, May 15th. The exhibition's curator, Dan Calderon, will be on the air talking with DJ Cousin Mary during the \"Reverb Hour\" from 8–9pm.  See more in “Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll,” online at: https://bit.ly/InstrumentalSurf - link via bio.",
