It had capacity for forty passengers, a medium range, and a built-in air-stair at the tail section.   Eastern Air Lines ordered sixty of the 4-0-4 and introduced the aircraft in 1951, with scheduled service commencing in early 1952. The airline operated the 4-0-4 primarily on its eastern U.S. routes over the next decade and branded the service as the “Silver Falcon.” TWA (Trans World Airlines) was the only other major carrier to order the airliner, and operated a fleet of forty. Other airlines operating the 4-0-4 included Southern Airways and Piedmont Airlines.",
