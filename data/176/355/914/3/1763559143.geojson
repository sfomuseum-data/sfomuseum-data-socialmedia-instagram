From one man’s dream to build community through roller skating to a band of runners taking action to protect a sacred public land from the threat of development, and from a community of activists creatively confronting one of the planet’s greatest environmental challenges to a rising literary star intent on sharing his inspiration with those who may need it most.  Our screening room may still be closed, but you can watch the videos online at: http://bit.ly/VideoArts \u003c--or navigate here via the link in our bio.",
