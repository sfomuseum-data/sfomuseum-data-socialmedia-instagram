This versatile uniform in polyester consists of a long-line cardigan-style jacket. Worn until 1980, it offered a slacks option, as well as a tunic with long sleeve blouse. Head incorporated Pan Am’s Universe Design motif seen on the belt buckle, scarf, and in the top-stitching on the felt slouch hat designed by Frank Olive (1929–1995).
