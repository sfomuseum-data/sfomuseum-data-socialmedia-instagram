        "body": "The Lockheed L-188 Electra was the only large turboprop airliner produced in the United States. The prototype flew in 1957; Eastern was the first to inaugurate service in January 1959. The regional airline PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines), based in San Diego, purchased three of the aircraft, which proved ideal for the carrierâ€™s West Coast routes. The Electra was introduced to great enthusiasm, but over the next several years, a major engine-mount design flaw was discovered. Although the defect was remedied, the airliner never regained the confidence of the public or major carriers. With the introduction of faster mid-range turbojets, the Electra was primarily relegated to regional airlines and cargo carriers.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
