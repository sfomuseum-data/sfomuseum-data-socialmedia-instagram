        "body": "Happy Birthday, American Airlines! American traces its origins to Robertson Aircraft and its first airmail contract flight. The airline celebrates its birthday as April 16, 1926, the date when Charles Lindbergh piloted the first airmail flight for Robertson, carrying mail from St. Louis, Missouri, to Chicago, Illinois. American Airways was later formed from a merger of Robertson and Colonial Air Transport. In 1934, it changed its name to American Airlines. What are your favorite memories about American Airlines?",
