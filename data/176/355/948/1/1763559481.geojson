        "body": "Celebrate August with four short films that remind us of the importance of bliss in our lives. From a trio of sisters who find joy and solace in the concrete bowls of Houston’s skate parks to a young man who finds bliss in the escape that street dancing provides, and from a legendary surfer grounded by his spiritual connection to the natural world to a man whose life’s work is to share the bliss he finds in roller skating with others, today’s filmmakers bring us stories that inspire and enlighten.  Our screening room may still be closed, but you can watch the films online at: http://bit.ly/VideoArts",
