It featured two turbojet engines in traditional under-wing mounts. Lufthansa German Airlines was the first carrier to place orders for the aircraft and influenced aspects of its design, including increasing the capacity to one hundred passengers. Lufthansa inaugurated the first service in 1968. The 737 has proved to have a resilient design; over 10,000 have been built in a variety of generations and variants, and the aircraft remains in production today.",
