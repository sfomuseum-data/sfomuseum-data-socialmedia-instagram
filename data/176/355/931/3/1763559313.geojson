        "body": "e Boeing 787 is the latest wide-body jet airliner manufactured by Boeing. Named the Dreamliner, the aircraft was first introduced by All Nippon Airways (ANA) in 2011.   The first Boeing 787s were assembled in the Everett, Washington, factory plant and, in 2021, Boeing consolidated 787 production and assembly to their North Charleston, South Carolina facility. The first commercial airliner with an airframe primarily made of composite materials, the Boeing 787 features larger windows than any other aircraft in service, as the composite materials do not require reinforcements like aircraft constructed of aluminum.   With three variations, the 787-8 can carry 248 passengers , 787-9 can seat 296 passengers, and largest variation, the 787-10 can transport 336 passengers, all in a two class configuration. The Boeing 787â€™s high-bypass turbofan engines were specifically designed for the airliner and also incorporates composite materials in their construction. The Dreamliner cruises at Mach .85 for the best fuel efficiency.",
