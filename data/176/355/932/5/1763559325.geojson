To celebrate the team’s 75th anniversary, SFO Museum presents the photography of Frank Rippon, which was first exhibited as part of the Airport’s celebration of Super Bowl 50, hosted by the San Francisco Bay Area in 2016.   Rippon became their “de facto” team photographer, documenting every home game from 1948 until his retirement in 1984.  Our photo essay “From Kezar to Candlestick: The Photography of Frank Rippon” is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. https://bit.ly/3D1Gb2e  All images in this exhibition are provided Courtesy of the Rippon Family Trust and may not be reproduced, copied, transmitted, or manipulated without the Trust’s written permission.",
