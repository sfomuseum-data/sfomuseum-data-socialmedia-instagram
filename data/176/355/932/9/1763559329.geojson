        "body": "The Airbus A380 is the world's only full-length double-decker commercial airliner. It is currently the largest operating passenger jet in the world; featuring a massive wingspan of 261 feet and 6 inches, each wing can weigh up to 33 tons. The fuselage of the aircraft is over 23 feet wide and to accommodate its maximum landing weight of 850,984 lbs, the aircraft features 22 wheels. Introduced by Singapore Airlines on October 25, 2007, Airbus decided to name the aircraft the A380, as the number 8 looked like a cross section of the double-decker fuselage and is considered a lucky number in some Asian countries. Depending on class configuration, the colossal aircraft can seat between 450 to 853 passengers. With a cruising speed of 561 mph, the A380 has a flight range of over 9,000 miles.   The parts of the airframes were built in multiple countries around Europe, with the wings built in the UK, the tail built in Spain and Germany, the fuselage built in Germany and France, and final assembly of all the parts in France. A daunting logistical challenge, the many parts of the plane were shipped, flown, and driven all over Europe to be assembled in a purpose built factory, the Jean-Luc Lagard√®re Plant, in Toulouse, France.   The last A380 built made its maiden flight in March 2021. 251 of the airliners were built between 2005 and 2021.",
