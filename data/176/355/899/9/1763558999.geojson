        "body": "Standing thirty-five feet tall, “Ether” is the first permanent artwork in the United States by Japanese artist #KoheiNawa. Resonating with the movement of nearby airplanes, the sculpture explores the concept of gravity, defied during takeoff, but used during landing. The form of the sculpture visualizes a droplet of liquid falling from sky to earth. It changes shape as gravity propels it downward, but encounters an equal counter force thrusting skyward. The resulting form is a symmetrical and potentially infinite column created within a space of zero gravity.  See “Ether” by #KoheiNawa online at: https://bit.ly/362jD2p",
