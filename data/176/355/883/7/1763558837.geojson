        "body": "Continental Airlines launched Boeing 747 jumbojet service in 1970. To promote its widebody-operator status, the airline introduced a new line of uniforms. Stewardesses were offered a choice of several ensembles. A form-fitting, polyester mini-dress projected a flashy, energetic look of casual comfort with bright stripes in Continental’s corporate colors (introduced a few years earlier). It featured a gold-tone chain belt with a monogrammed medallion. Worn with patterned scarves featuring the airline’s circular contrails logo and complemented with red pumps, the uniforms were issued until 1973 and were in use for the introduction of the airline’s next widebody airliner, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Do you remember this uniform?  See “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” online at: http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
