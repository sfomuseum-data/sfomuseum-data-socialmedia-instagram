        "body": "College radio is a key outlet for underground genres such as instrumental rock and surf music. Throughout the 1980s, DJ Jim Dunfrund hosted “Surfwave” on KXLU-FM at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. In the San Francisco Bay Area, DJ Phil Dirt featured “Surf’s Up” on KFJC-FM from Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, a tradition continued by DJ Cousin Mary every Saturday night on the KFJC Reverb Hour. We were lucky enough to have DJ Cousin Mary visit Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll, along with guitarist Ferenc Dobronyi of local surf music groups The TomorrowMen and Pollo del Mar, who are also featured in the exhibit.   See more of “Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll,” online, where you can also find a link to the exhibition playlist on Spotify. Link via bio.",
