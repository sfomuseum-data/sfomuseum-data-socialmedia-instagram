        "body": "Developed by the Glenn L. Martin Company, the Martin 2-0-2 was intended to supersede the DC-3. Pennsylvania Central Airlines and Colonial Airlines both placed orders for the aircraft in 1945, and both orders were  canceled due to production delays. The 2-0-2 was eventually introduced into service by Northwest Airlines in October 1947. The unpressurized 2-0-2 had a capacity of 40 passengers and a maximum speed of 311 miles per hour, much faster than the DC-3. With a range of just over 600 miles, it was designed to compete with the Convair 240 on short domestic routes. Though only 47 were built, the Martin 2-0-2 was flown by airlines such as Northwest Airlines, Pacific Air Lines, Trans World Airlines, and Allegheny Airlines.",
