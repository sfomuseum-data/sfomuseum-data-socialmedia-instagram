Wray recalled, “I’ve got bad eyes and I can’t hear real good so I had to play loud ‘cause I couldn’t play clean…The only reason I was doing instrumentals was because I couldn’t sing.”  The Danelectro Guitarlin “Longhorn” shown here dates to Wray’s early stint with Epic Records and is shown on the cover of the group’s first LP record, “Link Wray \u0026 The Wraymen”.
