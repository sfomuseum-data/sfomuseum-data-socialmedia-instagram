For her work, Konow travels to locations often visited by those in search of experiences connected to the mythologies of the landscape—canyons in the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco, waterfalls in eastern Maui, Hawai’i—and returns with images that reflect the often-intangible sensations that specific locations or geological features can evoke.
