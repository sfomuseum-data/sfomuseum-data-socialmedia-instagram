        "body": "Excelsior was one of the “Big Three” American motorcycle brands during the 1910s, along with rivals Harley-Davidson and Indian. While their first model used a Thor engine built under license, The Excelsior Motor and Manufacturing Company introduced the Auto-Cycle in 1908, a new design made at their seven-story facility in Chicago. The 3 ¼-horsepower Auto-Cycle was a success and demand quickly surpassed supply.  Bicycle maker Ignaz Schwinn (1860–1948) purchased Excelsior in 1911 and gave the motorcycle division another boost. A factory-backed racing team promoted Excelsior’s road bikes, and in 1912 at the Playa del Rey motordrome near Los Angeles, Lee Humiston (1889–1949) became the first racer—in an automobile or on a motorcycle—to exceed 100 miles-per-hour on a closed-course track. Production of Excelsior motorcycles continued until 1931, when Schwinn refocused on marketing bicycles to a Depression-era public.   “Early American Motorcycles” is on view pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall and online - link in bio.",
