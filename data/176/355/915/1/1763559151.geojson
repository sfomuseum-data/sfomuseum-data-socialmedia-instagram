The boxes and bags full of old rollers, rods, curlers, clips, combs, and barrettes that Hafler has acquired over the years inspired his one-of-a-kind “Hairsterical” sculptures, each of which features a different hairstyle. Among those on view are \"The Beehive,\" \"The Flip,\" \"The Bubble,\" and \"The Pompadour.\"  See more from “Hair Style,” which is on display post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online - link via bio.",
