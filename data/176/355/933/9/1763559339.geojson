        "body": "Happy Diwali! Diwali, the festival of lights, is an annual Hindu festival celebrated during the autumn season. The festival signifies the spiritual triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair. In his series “Rail Diwali”, Arko Datto explores how this festival is celebrated in some of the most underprivileged and heavily populated areas of Kolkata.  Constructed in British India during the mid-nineteenth century, the Kolkata Suburban Railway is the largest of its kind in India by track length and number of stations. In Kolkata today, nearly a third of the population lives in areas of informal housing, many of which are located on the borders of the suburban railway tracks.
