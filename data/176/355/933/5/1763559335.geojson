The screening room will show four new films each month and is located pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall next to Hudson News. The opening hours are from 5am to 10pm daily.  Celebrate November with four stories of Native American culture and tradition. From a Pyramid Lake Paiute mother passing equestrian traditions on to her children in northern Nevada to the expression of pride in family and culture among Navajo Nation members, and from a profile of a bronc rider in northwest Montana maintaining a connection to the “old ways” to the visual splendor of diverse Native American cultures at the annual Gathering of Nations Powwow in New Mexico, these four filmmakers share examples of endurance, pride, and inspiration.  SFO Museum’s Video Arts gallery is located pre-security on the departures level of International Terminal with daily operating hours of 5:00am to 10:00pm. http://bit.ly/VideoArts",
