        "body": "The Airbus A300 was the first wide-body airliner produced by Airbus Industries, a European aerospace manufacturing consortium formed in 1970. Air France introduced the aircraft in 1974 and Lufthansa followed two years later.   The fuselage of the A300 was wide enough to seat eight across in economy, which was arranged in a two-four-two configuration with two aisles. The first-class cabin seated six across, also with two aisles, in a two-two-two arrangement. The A300 could carry as many as 266 passengers in a two-class configuration, and with two engines instead of three, the A300 used approximately thirty percent less fuel than the DC-10 or the Lockheed L1011 TriStar. This amounted to a substantial reduction in operating costs and was one of the major reasons for the aircraftâ€™s success. 561 of the aircraft were built when production ended in 2007.",
