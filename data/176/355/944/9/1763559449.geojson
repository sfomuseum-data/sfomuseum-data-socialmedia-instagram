The City leased land from the Mills Estate to create a temporary, experimental municipal airport in 1927. By 1930, weather studies confirmed that the site was the best possible location for an airport, and San Francisco began a ten-year purchasing program with the Mills Estate to acquire 1,112 acres of land. Payment was made in annual installments of $105,000 each, the first of which was paid on August 30, 1930.",
