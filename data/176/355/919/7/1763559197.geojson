        "body": "Learning printmaking, whether in isolation or in \"normal times\" takes time and discipline, a willingness to experiment and possibly fail, and determination to master new materials and processes. @sfsu_school_of_art students created monoprints now on display in Intermediate Printmaking led by professor and printmaker Susan Belau in the fall of 2020. Typically, Belau teaches the class in a studio equipped with printing presses, rollers, a full complement of color inks, large printing plates, and papers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Belau taught the class online. Students set up their own studios, using minimal space, small formats, and just a few specialized tools for printing at home. This group of students met the challenge presented by COVID-19 and produced works that include traditional monoprint, hand-coloring, toner-transfer, and collage. Themes address political, social, and personal challenges, which took on new urgency and meaning in 2020. The images act as tributes to friendship and family, reflect on the contemporary landscape, and imagine places beyond our current constraints.  \"Impressions in Isolation: Monoprints from SFSU\" is on view pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online - link via bio.",
