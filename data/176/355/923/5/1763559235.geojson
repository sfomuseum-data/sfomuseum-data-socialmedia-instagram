        "body": "The Douglas DC-3 was arguably the most significant commercial airliner introduced prior to World War II. Conceived of by Arthur Raymond and introduced in 1936, the DC-3 incorporated numerous advancements, including a strong, highly streamlined, all-aluminum, semi-monocoque fuselage, and a low-drag wing design. The aircraft proved aerodynamically superior, highly reliable, safe, easy to maintain, and for the first time, enabled carriers to make a profit from passenger services. More than four hundred DC-3s were initially ordered by most major airlines. By 1940, nearly three million passengers had flown in DC-3s, and the aircraft had collectively logged over one hundred million miles. By the end of production, more than ten thousand commercial and military transport versions had been built, and a few are still flown today.
