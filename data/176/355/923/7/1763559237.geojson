        "body": "Like their counterparts in the United States, international instrumental bands in the late 1950s and 1960s were influenced by rhythm and blues and rock ‘n’ roll. The Shadows, a group of teenagers from London, led the European instrumental charge. In Japan, Takeshi Terauchi (b. 1939) and Yūzō Kayama (b. 1937) sparked a craze for electric guitar music known as Eleki. Some countries had their own surfing cultures and instrumental surf music, evidenced by groups such as The Atlantics in Australia and Los Belking’s in Peru.   See more of “Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll,” online, where you can also find a link to the exhibition playlist on Spotify. Link in bio.",
