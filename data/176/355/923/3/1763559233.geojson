        "body": "As the commercial aviation industry grew in the early 1930s, it became apparent that San Francisco Airport needed to enlarge and enhance their passenger facilities. Construction began in 1936 for a new administration building. It measured 88 feet by 206 feet and was sited where the 1927 building stood. Designed in a modernized Spanish Revival style, the new building included a four-story control tower, meteorological observation platform, and weather department offices, in addition to a spacious passenger waiting room and numerous amenities. The new building was dedicated and opened to the public on October 24, 1937.  Filed under both \"Fun fact\" and \"They did what?\": the original 1927 Administration Building was relocated to the north and the two structures coexisted for several years.",
