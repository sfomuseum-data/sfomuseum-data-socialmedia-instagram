        "body": "Alicia McCarthy’s paintings are driven by material and repetition. She interlaces ribbons of spray paint, latex paint, crayon, and pencil that are reducible as parts, but expansive in their totality. With roots in the Bay Area’s graffiti and punk scenes, McCarthy’s paintings are an exercise in resisting the impulse to control. Her splatters, smudges, and imperfect lines signal an embrace of variation, disruption, and the limitations of both materials and the hand that wields them.  See “Untitled” by Alicia McCarthy, on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/36XeD0C",
