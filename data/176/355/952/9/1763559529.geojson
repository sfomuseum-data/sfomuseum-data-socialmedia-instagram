The building served as Pan American Airways’ base for operations throughout the Caribbean, Central, and South America. As landplanes became more widely used, Pan American eventually moved all operations to its 36th Street airfield, now Miami International Airport. In 1954, the City of Miami converted the Dinner Key building into its City Hall, and the Pan American Airways winged-globe logo can still be found on the building’s façade.",
