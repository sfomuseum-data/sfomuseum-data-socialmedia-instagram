Incorporating fly-by-wire controls, which was first introduced on the A320, the A340 allows for easy transfer of qualified pilots from one aircraft to another. The A340 has a capacity to accommodate between 210 and 440 passengers and a range of 6,700 to 9,000 nautical miles, depending on the variant. Still in service, Airbus ceased production of the A340 in 2011.",
