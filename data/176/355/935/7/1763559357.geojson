        "body": "Taking off from Idlewild Airport in New York #onthisday in 1958, Pan American World Airways became the first airline to inaugurate scheduled transatlantic commercial jet service on a Boeing 707. 111 passengers (40 first class and 71 coach) boarded the jetliner, named “Clipper America,” bound for Le Bourget Airport, Paris. The Boeing 707 was the first viable commercial jetliner to operate with regular and sustained service and effectively launched a new era in commercial air travel, the Jet Age. The jet’s greater speed and higher passenger capacity enabled the airlines to substantially reduce their seat-mile costs, and thus lower ticket prices opening up air travel to a large percentage of the public. Have you ever flown on a Boeing 707?",
