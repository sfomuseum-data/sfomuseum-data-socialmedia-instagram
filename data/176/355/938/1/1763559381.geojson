The medium- to short-haul, narrow-bodied aircraft have ranges of up to 4,315 miles and cruising speeds of around 515mph. The first to feature an entirely computerized glass cockpit and digital fly-by-wire flight control technology, the A320 family is advertised for “improved safety and reduced pilot workload.” The different iterations indicate various sizes. The A318 can seat up to 132 passengers, the 319 up to 156 passengers, the 320 up to 186 passengers and the 321 up to 236 passengers.",
