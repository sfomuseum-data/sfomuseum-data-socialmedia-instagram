        "body": "New exhibition alert! “The Victorian Papered Wall” is now on display pre-security in the International Terminal.   From its inception, wallpaper imitated luxurious materials, providing a more affordable alternative to tapestries, fabrics, mural paintings, and architectural elements. Crafted in repeating rolls and pasted to walls, wallpaper has an ephemeral quality unlike other decorative arts. Wallpaper reflects the design styles popular at the time, and in the late nineteenth century during the Victorian Era (1837–1901), walls richly came to life.  Hand silkscreened in Benicia, California, the Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers presented in this exhibition are Victorian-era room sets that feature both wall and elaborate ceiling papers.   Special thank you to Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers for making this exhibition possible; and to wallpaper hanger Heidi Wright Mead, C. P. for leading the wallpaper installation. https://bit.ly/VictorianPaperedWall",
