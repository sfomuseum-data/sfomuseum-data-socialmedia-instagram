        "body": "It's #WingWednesday! The Boeing 707 was originally developed following an initial request in 1955 from Pan American World Airways for a large capacity jet-powered airliner. First flown in 1957, Pan Am introduced the jetliner in October 1958 by inaugurating 707-120 service from New York to Paris with one refueling stop in Newfoundland.   As a result of its reliability, capacity, and considerably reduced seat-mile cost, the 707 ultimately proved to be the world's first viable commercial jetliner with regular and sustained scheduled service, and revolutionized the airline industry by ushering in the jet age. By the mid-1960s, the 707 had been acquired by a long list of carriers and could be seen regularly at airports across the globe. Over eight hundred of the jetliner were eventually produced.",
