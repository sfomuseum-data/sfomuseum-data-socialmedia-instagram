        "body": "Motorcycle clubs have offered camaraderie and support for motorcyclists since the earliest days of riding. These clubs organize rides, races, endurance runs, and other social events to promote and sustain the motorcycling hobby. The Alpha Motorcycle Club of Brooklyn, New York, formed in March 1902 as the first motorcycle club in the United States. Soon thereafter, the Pacific Coast Motor Bicycle Club organized in San Francisco as the first motorcycle club on the West Coast.   In October 1904, the San Francisco Motorcycle Club (SFMC) was founded by bicycle racer and Indian motorcycle dealer C.C. “Daddy” Hopkins (1859–1948) and other members of the Pacific Coast club who decided to start their own organization. The SFMC planned races, weekend tours, and on the evening of April 17, 1906, they held a dance at their new meeting hall on Jefferson Square in downtown San Francisco. Early the next morning, the Great San Francisco Earthquake and ensuing fire devastated the city. The SFMC meeting hall was converted to a temporary hospital and members utilized their motorcycles to deliver supplies and messages throughout the Bay Area. The SFMC quickly reorganized, and in 1908 they hosted events that included a seventy-mile ride to Mount Hamilton and a weekend of racing at Tanforan Park in nearby San Bruno.  “Early American Motorcycles” is on view pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall and online - link in bio.
