        "body": "This is your last week to catch \"Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll.\" Instrumental surf music originated in Southern California in the early 1960s along with a booming interest in surfing and the subsequent pop-cultural craze. A revival of instrumental surf music occurred during the early 1980s and spread worldwide in the 1990s. The music is now more diverse than ever, and there are active surf and instrumental scenes throughout the United States and in Mexico, Brazil, Australia, Japan, and across Europe.   \"Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2 and online: https://bit.ly/InstrumentalSurf  Listen to the Spotify playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5AQyPu211uyVR3H8H4nsqq?si=ZNTMJcBxTCG1ZSpj1MXy8Q",
