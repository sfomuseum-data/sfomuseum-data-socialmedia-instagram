        "body": "The first wave of instrumental surf music captivated young people all across the United States. Surf music was loud and dynamic, driven by Fender guitars played through the company’s new Reverb unit, which produced a watery, echo-like effect. Surf groups backed their lead and rhythm guitar parts with a melodic bassline and a powerful rhythm section, sometimes with a saxophone included for additional intensity. Hundreds of instrumental surf bands pressed a multitude of 45-RPM singles and LP records, producing both regional and national hits. Album cover artwork and graphic design reflected California’s surfing culture and is a colorful reminder of the 1960s surf music scene.  See more of “Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll,” online, where you can also find a link to the exhibition playlist on Spotify. Link in bio.",
