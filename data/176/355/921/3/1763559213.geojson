Our screening room is still closed, but weâ€™re continuing our month-long online programming with four films that take us from a celebration of Native American culture in the American Southwest to a walk through a Slovakian streetscape, and from the passion of a Haitian-born street dancer to an animated meditation on the potential for a romantic connection in a chance encounter.   Watch the videos online at: http://bit.ly/VideoArts \u003c--or navigate here via the link in our bio.",
