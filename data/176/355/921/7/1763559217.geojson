        "body": "Although Lockheed's Model 14 Super Electra performed admirably, its larger competitor, the Douglas DC-3, was less expensive to operate. Elongating the fuselage of the Super Electra by five-and-a-half feet allowed for the placement of two more rows of seats; the revised aircraft was designated the Model 18 Lodestar and first flew in September 1939.   The added seats allowed the Lodestar to compete economically with the DC-3, but despite its superior performance, many U.S. airlines had fully committed to the DC-3. The first airliner was acquired in 1940 by Mid-Continent Airlines, which operated throughout the Midwest and was aquired in 1952 by Braniff. Most sales of the aircraft were to foreign airlines or, as the U.S. military focused on improving its air strength in the buildup to entering World War II, to the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marines Corps. Following WWII, a number of the aircraft were converted into private or executive aircraft with a sleek, club-style interior.",
