After World War II, numerous European airlines, including BEA, purchased surplus C-47 military transports and had them converted to DC-3 commercial use. BEA introduced the turboprop Vickers Viscount, the worldâ€™s first jet-powered airliner to enter service, in 1950 and inaugurated scheduled service in 1953. BEA inaugurated Comet 4B jetliner service to numerous destinations in Europe in April 1960. In 1974, BEA merged with British Overseas Airways Corporation to form British Airways, the current flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom.",
