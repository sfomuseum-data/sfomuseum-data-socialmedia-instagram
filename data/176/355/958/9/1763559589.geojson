        "body": "The airline industry soared to new heights in the 1950s. Driven by great advances in aviation technology and a burgeoning consumer market, new commercial airliners introduced the future of air travel to the next generation of passengers. To keep pace with the revolution in commercial aviation, major airports around the world updated their facilities with longer runways, expansive taxiways, and modern passenger terminals. Construction of a new terminal at San Francisco Airport began in 1951. Designed in the International Style, the seven-story building employed an innovative, dual-level layout that separated departures from arrivals. Our exhibition, \"The 1954 San Francisco International Airport Terminal\" features a selection of objects and historic imagery from the first decade of operations at the 1954 Terminal building. All material is from the collection of SFO Museum.   See \"The 1954 San Francisco International Airport Terminal\" on display in the SkyTerrace and online at: http://bit.ly/SFO1954  The SkyTerrace, located pre-security in Terminal 2, is open Friday-Monday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and it is free! https://bit.ly/3F20GOc",
