        "body": "In his series “Rail Diwali”, Arko Datto explores how Diwali, a fall festival of the spiritual victory of light over darkness, is celebrated in some of the most underprivileged and heavily populated areas of Kolkata in East India. The Kolkata Suburban Railway is the largest of its kind in India by track length and number of stations. In Kolkata today, nearly a third of the population lives in areas of informal housing, many of which are located on the borders of the suburban railway tracks.   Long interested in these semi-permanent dwellings and their complicated relationship to the railways, Datto makes images that approach histories of colonialism, migration, and poverty through a filter of colorful lights and the celebratory atmosphere of Diwali. Drenched in the saturated colors of the festival, the artist draws focus on a distinct sense of community, belonging, and strength despite the adversities facing many of the celebrants.
