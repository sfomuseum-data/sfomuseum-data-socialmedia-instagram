Dubbed “The Classic Collection” after his similarly named uniform series from 1968, it showcased a fantastic, swirling Pucci print along with monochromatic blue and green elements that could be combined for more than twenty-five different looks. As with other Braniff uniforms, the 1974 Classic Collection featured a decorative, gold-plated, dove-shaped pin by Alexander Girard (1907–93).   \"Flight Patterns\" is on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: http://bit.ly/FlightPatternsSFOM",
