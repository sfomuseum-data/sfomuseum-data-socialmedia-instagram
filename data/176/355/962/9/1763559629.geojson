        "body": "#Onthisday in 1949, Pan American World Airways received their first delivery of a Boeing 377 Stratocruiser. Considered the most luxurious airliner in the skies at the time, advertisements promoted its exceedingly smooth ride, its large, roomy, upper deck, and in particular, the Stratocruiser’s unique and luxurious lower-deck lounge. With a range of just over 4,000 miles, the airliner was ideally suited for transoceanic routes. Pan American World Airways launched Stratocruiser transpacific service from San Francisco to Hawai’i in April 1949, and transatlantic service to London in June 1949 as all first-class “The President” service.  Its unique, pressurized, “double-bubble” fuselage was equipped with two decks; the upper contained a roomy main cabin, with passenger accommodations for up to 100, depending on the seating configuration, while the lower featured the highly popular cocktail lounge. The lounge was accessed by a spiral staircase, had wrap-around, sofa-style seating for up to fourteen.",
