        "body": "Our newest exhibition  is now on display in Terminal 3. The Tuskegee Airmen were a group of primarily African American pilots and airmen who fought in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. Until their formation, racist conclusions drawn from a 1920s War Department study prevented Black aviators and airmen from serving in the U.S. armed forces. With war imminent in 1941, the first all-Black military unit was created—the 99th Pursuit Squadron. Later, the all-Black 332nd Fighter Group was formed, which consisted of the 101st, 301st, and 302nd fighter squadrons. By the end of the war, the 332nd had proved their flying skills well beyond the expectations of many in the military’s leadership and were among the most decorated squadrons within the U.S. Army Air Forces.  These images of the 332nd in Ramitelli in March of 1945 are from the Library of Congress and were created by photographer Toni Frissell (1907-88), a successful fashion photographer during the 1930s and early 40s. See our photo essay “Red Tails at Ramitelli: The Tuskegee Airmen in 1945” on display, post-security, in Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3Hr6uld",
