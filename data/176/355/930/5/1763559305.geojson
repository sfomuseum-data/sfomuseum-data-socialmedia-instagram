        "body": "As airline travel became more reliable during the 1930s, San Francisco’s airport initiated major improvements to keep pace. By 1937, SFO had paved and widened runways and taxiways to welcome heavier and faster airliners such as the Douglas DC-3, while boundary and runway lights allowed for safer night operations. A grand Spanish Colonial Revival-style passenger terminal, complete with a modern four-story control tower, also opened that year—crowning the first phase of expansion at the airport.   ”Mills Field and the San Francisco Airport” traces the evolution of SFO from a temporary airfield to a thriving and modern transportation hub. See the exhibition, on display pre-security in the SkyTerrace, located in Terminal 2. SkyTerrace is open Friday - Monday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. https://bit.ly/MillsFieldSFO",
