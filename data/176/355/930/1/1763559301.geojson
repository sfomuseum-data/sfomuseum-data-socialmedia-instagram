        "body": "In her series “Surface Tension”, Tabitha Soren (@tabithasoren) (b.1967) examines our complex relationship with technology and draws focus on our increasingly tactile connection to visual information. Using a large-format film camera, Soren photographs tablet screens to reveal the marks left behind—the fingerprints, smudges, and oily residue of our engagement with the images below the surface. Exposed by the artist’s use of raking light, the otherwise invisible marks come alive with color and texture. Organic, gestural, and almost primal, these swipe marks stand in stark contrast to the smooth curves and cool indifference of the device itself. Brought together, Soren’s images serve as a poignant meditation on the role of digital devices in society and offer a reminder of the traces, both physical and digital, that we leave behind when using them.
