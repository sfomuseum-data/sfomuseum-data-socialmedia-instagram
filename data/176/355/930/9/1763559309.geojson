        "body": "Thomas Chandler and other potters of Edgefield, South Carolina, often mixed different clays together to achieve the proper balance and ground their clays in a pug mill to obtain the right consistency for turning. The potter weighed the necessary amount of clay according to the size of the vessel that they wanted to produce, kneaded the clay, then formed the clay into a ball. The clay was then ready to be turned on a “kick” or treadle wheel. Lastly, the dried wares were coated with an alkaline glaze solution.   “Stoneware Stories: Folk Pottery of Edgefield, South Carolina” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall, near the security checkpoint for the A gates. See it online at http://bit.ly/StonewareStories",
