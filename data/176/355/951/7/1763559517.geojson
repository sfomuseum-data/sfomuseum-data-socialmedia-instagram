They came up with the perfect, conservator-approved solution: utilizing Fosshape, a non-woven material that’s soft and pliable until heat or steam is applied, which causes its form to fix while retaining its soft surface. Our preparators created the forms upon which to mold the material on, trimmed the solidified Fosshape supports to their final sizes, and set foam and wood core underneath for support and hardware mounting.
