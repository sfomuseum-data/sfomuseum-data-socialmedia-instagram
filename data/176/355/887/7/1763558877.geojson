These mural-like wallpapers were particularly popular in the U.S. and Europe in the 1800s and have the ability to completely transform rooms. Zuber et Cie uses original antique printing blocks, which the French Ministry of Culture has designated as Historical Monuments, and anywhere from over one hundred to several thousand blocks are needed to create a scenic paper set.   Read about how these papers are created on our website: http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
