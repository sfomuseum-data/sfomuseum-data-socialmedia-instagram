        "body": "Bay Area local Eugene Leach (1919-2000) spent his teenage years watching the planes take off and land at Oakland Airport and operating a ham radio. The two hobbies merged in his career as a radio operator for Pan American Airways, during which he was an accidental participant in the California Clipper's historic round-the-world flight - a result of the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. He never lost his passion for ham radio and was an avid sender and collector of QSL cards, which confirm contacts between two stations or broadcasters. Pride in his career with Pan Am are clear in his own QSL cards.  QSL cards, Eugene Leach SFO Museum Collection, Gift of the Pan Am Association 2000.058.1431, 2000.058.1435",
