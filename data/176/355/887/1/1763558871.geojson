During their spring 2020 class, professor and photographer Sean McFarland and students worked at home, utilizing almost alchemical nineteenth-century photography methods to create photograms, cyanotypes, and lumen prints, with household objects such as casserole dishes functioning as developing trays to process images. The completed artworks express how these artists experienced and responded to this complicated time period.   \"Alternative Process: San Francisco State University School of Art\" is on view pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at https://bit.ly/34x2Vc9",
