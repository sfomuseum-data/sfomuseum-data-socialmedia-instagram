        "body": "With an unerring instinct for where to place and reposition himself around the field throughout the game, San Francisco native Frank Rippon captured unforgettable moments from the first four decades of the 49er’s history. His iconic black-and-white images document the legendary exploits of players who forged an intimate bond with the city and its fans—from early stars like Hugh McElhenny and Bob St. Clair playing at Kezar Stadium, to Joe Montana and the generation of players who brought home the team’s first Super Bowl trophy in 1982 and earned the moniker “Team of the ‘80s” while playing at Candlestick Park.
