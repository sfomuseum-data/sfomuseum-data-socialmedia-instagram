There was an “open all night” gas station on the approach to the Central Terminal (now Terminal 2) and the South Terminal (now Harvey Milk Terminal 1) was just being built to accommodate growing passenger numbers. If you look closely, you can see “Peace” (1939) by Beniamino Bufano (1890–1970), which stood outside the airport for nearly forty years.",
