Perhaps the most streamlined design to enter the market was the 1941 Petipoint iron, designed by Clifford Brooks Stevens (1911–1995) and Edward P. Schreyer (1886–1980) with a pointed teardrop shape, wing-like projections, and a curved handle with speed lines. \"Streamlines: Air Age Aesthetics for Industrial Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Streamlines",
