        "body": "To create “The Hexapodarium” series, Gail Wight focused her creative vision on the housefly, an insect that evolved sixty-five-million-years ago. Their wings display a variety of unusual and beautiful shapes. After cleaning her studio on a particularly hot summer day, she was amazed at the insects’ resiliency and decided to photograph it’s wings beneath a few different types of microscopes, which accounts for the color difference in the final images. Wight works primarily in sculpture, video, interactive media, and print. Wight constructs biological allegories, examining the impacts of life sciences on humans, plants, and animals. The interplay between art and biology, theories of evolution, cognition, and the animal state-of-being are themes that have, over the last two decades, become central to Wight’s art. Gail Wight’s “The Hexapodarium” series is now on display pre-security in Terminal 3.",
