Credited with creating the miniskirt and the go-go style “Courrèges boot,” his trim, futuristic youth fashions embraced pant suits and synthetic materials. His 1973 uniform collection for UTA (Union de Transport Aériens) had a skirt or flared trousers option, a fitted sweater, and a short jacket in imitation leather. The pearlescent pink, powder blue, or red outfits came with white vinyl flat boots.",
