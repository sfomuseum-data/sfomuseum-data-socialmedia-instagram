Her work explores the varying relationships between the past and popular culture by referencing social issues such as racism, gender inequality, and immigration. Doongarwal’s goal is to give a voice to social issues that women and people of color face around the world. Through her art and advocacy awareness, she hopes to encourage people to embrace cultural diversity and fight for the equality of all genders, colors, races, and religions.  “Identity” by Nimisha Doongarwal is on display pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/3HAiyAX",
