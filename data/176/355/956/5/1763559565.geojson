NASA’s Langley Research Center employed hundreds of female computers from the mid-1930s to the ’70s. During the 1940s, Langley began recruiting African American women, such as Dorothy Vaughan (1910–2008), a former math teacher, who joined the “West Area Computing” unit, an all-Black group of female mathematicians, in 1943.
