Named after a star in the Pleiades cluster, the plane's sleek appearance is punctuated by its signature twin tail, which became a hallmark of Lockheed design. One hundred forty-nine of the aircraft were built in a variety of variants, the most famous arguably being the modified Model 10E flown by Amelia Earhart on her ill-fated attempted around-the-world flight.",
