        "body": "The Martin Model 130 flying boat was designed to meet Pan American Airways requirements for a long-range, transoceanic aircraft to cross the immense expanses of the Pacific. It was a clean, aerodynamic design compared to the earlier Sikorsky S-42 and was equipped with “sea wings” for buoyancy, instead of sponsons. It also had a very large fuel capacity, which gave it a range of over 3,000 miles. Only three were built: the China Clipper, Philippine Clipper, and Hawaii Clipper. Shortly after its delivery in 1935, the China Clipper became famous when, captained by Edwin C. Musick, it inaugurated the first transpacific airmail service from San Francisco Bay to Manila Harbor. The next year, the Philippine Clipper inaugurated the first transpacific passenger air service.",
