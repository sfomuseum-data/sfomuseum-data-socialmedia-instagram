        "body": "The Sikorsky S-42 was developed to meet the requirements of Pan American Airways’ president Juan T. Trippe for a large, long-range, trans-oceanic flying boat. Designed by Igor Sikorsky, with input from Charles Lindbergh, it could carry a crew of four and thirty-two passengers up to 1,200 miles. The \"Brazilian Clipper\" NC-822M was the first to enter service in 1934. It primarily flew Pan American’s Latin American routes. Later upgraded versions included the S-42A and S-42B, which were equipped with more powerful engines and had a range of up to 2,800 miles. S-42 types conducted route survey flights in the Pacific and North Atlantic, along with serving many of the airline’s routes, including the Manila–Hong Kong leg of transpacific service to China in the late 1930s.",
