        "body": "Marjorie Joyner (1896-1994) enrolled in the A. B. Molar Beauty School in 1916, became its first Black graduate, and opened her own salon at age twenty. Having learned to style white hair at Molar, Joyner decided to learn the Madam C. J. Walker method of styling African American hair. After meeting Joyner in Chicago, Walker offered her a position in the company, and before long, Joyner served as the national supervisor for Madam C. J. Walker beauty schools.  In 1928, Joyner patented her own permanent wave machine. Among her many achievements include becoming a founding member of the National Council of Negro Women in 1935, helping to write Illinois' first cosmetology laws in the 1940s, and in 1946, founding the United Beauty School Owners and Teachers Association (UBSOTA) for Black beauticians.",
