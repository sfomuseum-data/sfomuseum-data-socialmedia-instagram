        "body": "As the seventies progressed, postmodern pluralism brought greater diversity to fashion and several themes with overlapping elements emerged among the airlines. The multi-piece wardrobe became a lasting principle where the many combination choices included skirts or pants. The popular power-dressing looks of the 1980s had a sustained influence on the business suit styles at airlines. This form of traditionalism, when coupled with the nostalgia movement in fashion, brought renewed romanticism to airlines. Designers expressed timeless elegance with their contemporary casual wear, such as the belted jacket, while others explored retro-chic by revisiting motifs to create parodies of styles from decades past. With more conservative designs thought to convey respectability and competence, many uniforms conformed to standard business attire, with a predominance of navy blue. This more recent shift to an inter-airline uniformity, however, simultaneously creates opportunity for greater contrast. It enables those that select the more stylish silhouettes and bolder colors to once again stand out, and to keep fashion at the forefront of airline identity.",
