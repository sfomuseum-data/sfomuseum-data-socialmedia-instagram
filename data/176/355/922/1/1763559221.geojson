        "body": "While sitting in the salon (perhaps for the first time in over a year) have you ever wondered how blowout styling started? Rose Evansky (1922-2016), a Polish Jew who fled to Britain from Nazi Germany, pioneered it in the early 1960s in London.   After passing by a barbershop and viewing a barber dry the front of a man’s hair with a handheld dryer and brush, Rose thought she would try the same on her female clients. She began rolling sections of wet hair around the brush and drying them with a handheld dryer. The new, soft “blow wave” quickly swept across London and the coveted style has led to salons solely offering what is now referred to as a “blowout.”  Hand-held electric hair dryers became available in the first decade of the twentieth century. Loud, heavy, and expensive, early dryers operated with low wattage and required long drying times.  See “Hair Style” on display, post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 or online - link in bio.",
