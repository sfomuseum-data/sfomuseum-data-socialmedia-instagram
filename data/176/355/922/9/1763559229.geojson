Pan American Airways ordered six of the original version and six more 314A variants, three of which were sold before delivery to the British. The B-314 was introduced to Pan Am's Pacific Division and used to open its Atlantic service in 1939. Designed by Wellwood E. Beall, it distinguished itself by shear size, three vertical stabilizers in the tail, and cantilevered seawings that doubled as fuel tanks. A flight crew of up to ten was required to operate the \"Super Clipper.\"  Those three vertical stabilizers weren't part of the original design, though. Check out our story for images of the first B-314 during its testing period.",
