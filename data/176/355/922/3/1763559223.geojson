        "body": "The San Francisco Airport of yore paid just as much attention to detail to the look and feel of its passenger areas as it does today. The 1937 Administration Building cost $160,000 to build and was funded through the Federal Public Works Administration. The stair and balcony railings were done in antique wrought iron that matched the lighting fixtures, and two chandeliers hung from the stenciled ceiling. The woodwork was oak, the countertops were of Belgian black marble travertine, and the floor was patterned in a four-color terrazzo. The day after the facility opened on October 24, 1937, the San Francisco Chronicle declared, “San Francisco has finally taken its rightful place as one of the Nation’s major terminals.”",
