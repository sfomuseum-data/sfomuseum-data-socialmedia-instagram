One of the obvious ones that I can cite was being, in the springtime, in Hokkaido and noticing the small spring flowers coming up, which were quite pretty, here and there, then using a lot of little colors in reference to my sculptures, not copying the colors but just using a lot of little colors. And that was a reference to those flowers.\" —Marvin Lipofsky; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 2003  Marvin Lipofsky (1938–2016) was a founding member of the American studio glass movement. For close to five decades, he worked in glass factories and workshops all over the world, earning him the title of the “roving ambassador of glass.”  \"Marvin Lipofsky: International Studio Glass\" is on view pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/MarvinLipofsky",
