The diminutive field lighting control building was constructed in 1937 in the same Spanish Revival style as the Administrative Building, with attention to detail given to even the decorative elements within the window grills and vents. The building was originally located across a parking lot from Hangar No. 2. By the time it was torn down, it was just west of the end of runway 28L.",
