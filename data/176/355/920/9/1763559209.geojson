Then I was promoted to the cook kitchen, and from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations. I have built my own factory on my own ground!” —Madam C. J. Walker addressing the National Negro Business League in Chicago, 1912  Entrepreneur, philanthropist, and social activist, Madam C. J. Walker (1867–1919) created a haircare empire, including a product line, training schools, and salons, which made her one of the wealthiest African Americans of her time. Walker garnered the support of Booker T. Washington, one of the nation’s most powerful advocates for Black businesses, and she supported Black colleges, secondary schools, and social organizations, such as Black YMCA branches.
