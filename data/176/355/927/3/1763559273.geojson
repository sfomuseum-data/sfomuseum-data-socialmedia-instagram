        "body": "The Zeppelin Company built and operated the Graf Zeppelin from Germany. Launched in 1928, the Graf Zeppelin measured 776 feet in length and 100 feet in diameter. The airship featured a duralumin skeleton with triangular girders and a single keel. Within the frame were seventeen bays for hydrogen gas cells, within twelve of these bays, located below the hydrogen bags, were storage bags for Blau gas, a revolutionary airship gas used as fuel for the Maybach engines which weighed the same as air. The Blau gas caused no change in the balance of the airship. The gas extended the range of the craft by nearly thirty hours of flying time. Powered by five Maybach V-12 engines, the Zeppelin had a cruising speed of seventy-five miles an hour.  During its 590 flights, it flew more than one million miles and carried a total of 13,110 passengers.",
