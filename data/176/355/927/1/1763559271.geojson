        "body": "SFO Museum celebrates the reopening of the Airport’s Video Arts screening room after a 20-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program features a rotating exhibition of four short films with new films introduced each month. This month, we’re featuring four filmmakers from around the world whose work directly and indirectly reflects how the pandemic impacts our lives and our interaction with one another. Together, these artists help us understand the world we are navigating, and inspire us with stories of beauty and resilience.  See these films in the Video Arts Gallery, located pre-security, in the International Terminal with daily operating hours of 5:00am to 10:00pm or online at: http://bit.ly/VideoArts",
