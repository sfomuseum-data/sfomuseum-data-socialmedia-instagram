        "body": "In the 1930s, Pan American Airways’ flying boats captured the imagination of a generation, as they dramatically reduced the amount of time it took to travel between continents. As instant icons of popular culture, Pan Am’s “Clipper” ships began appearing on all sorts of products and promotions. For example, this packaging for “China Clipper” sewing needles from the period has an illustration of a flying boat now added to the rail, steamer, and airship modes of transportation.  Learn more about early transpacific aviation in \"China Clipper\" on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/chinaclipper",
