        "body": "After World War II, Fokker Aircraft of the Netherlands struggled amid a surplus of military transports unloaded on the market. By the mid-1950s, the company began developing an airliner that would ultimately fill a major niche in regional commercial aviation and turn around the company, the F-27 Friendship. The high-wing, short-range design incorporated two powerful Rolls Royce Dart turboprop engines and featured outstanding short takeoff and landing capabilities, which made it ideal for regional airlines operating out of small airports. The aircraft would eventually prove to be one of the most successful and enduring regional airliner designs of the postwar era and beyond, with nearly 600 produced and operated worldwide.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
