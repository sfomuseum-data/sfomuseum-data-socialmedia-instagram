Developed as a joint endeavor between the governments of Great Britain and France, the aircraft that made this flight, Concorde 001, was built in France. Concorde commercial service was launched in 1976. A supersonic transatlantic flight between Paris and Washington D.C. lasted on average just three and one-half hours at 1,350 miles per hour, faster than the speed of the Earth's rotation. All Concorde SSTs were retired in 2003.",
