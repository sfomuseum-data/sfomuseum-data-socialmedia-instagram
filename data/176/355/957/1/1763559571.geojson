        "body": "As an openly gay politician and civil rights leader, Harvey Milk regularly received death threats. Tragically, on November 27, 1978, a disgruntled former supervisor, Dan White, entered through an open basement window and assassinated Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk in their City Hall offices.  “We were trapped there in the office as the police bundled up the bodies and I just thought, ‘Everything’s over.’ But then the sun went down and tens of thousands of people gathered here at this intersection and marched down to City Hall, filled Civic Center, and I realized I was, you know, completely wrong. It wasn’t over. It was just the beginning.”  Harvey Milk’s protégé and friend, activist Cleve Jones (b. 1954) 2015 radio interview on WFDD, Winston-Salem, North Carolina  The first candlelight march occurred on the evening of the assassination of Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk. As the news of the assassinations reached the public, tens of thousands of shocked and grief-stricken citizens spontaneously gathered in the Castro neighborhood and marched in a silent candlelight vigil down Market Street to congregate at City Hall.  Our exhibition “Messenger of Hope” celebrates the life of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay individual elected to public office in the state of California. “Messenger of Hope” is on display both pre- and post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1, and online at: http://bit.ly/HarveyMilkExhibition",
