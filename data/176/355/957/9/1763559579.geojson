        "body": "“The Color of Horizons” is a site-specific, suspended light sculpture by Dana Hemenway. The artist is known for applying weaving and macramé techniques to utilitarian objects to elevate and transform the object beyond its original functionality. For this installation, she also draws from San Francisco’s surroundings––specifically the frequently changing sky, due to wind and fog. The work takes its title from Rebecca Solnit’s book, \"A Field Guide to Getting Lost.\" Hemenway was inspired by the author’s ponderings on the idea of the horizon. Solnit explains, “For many years, I have been moved by the blue at the far edge of what can be seen, the color of horizons, of remote mountain ranges, of anything far away… the color of there seen from here, the color of where you are not. And the color of where you can never go.”  See “The Color of Horizons” by Dana Hemenway, on display pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/302FG6a",
