This was the place where they had the symposium exhibition and so forth with all the flags from the various countries there. I am trying to give you a feeling for the experience that I had. I just can’t believe that I did all this stuff.\"  —Marvin Lipofsky; Glass Art Society, 2009  Marvin Lipofsky, a star student of Harvey Littleton in the nation’s first glass program at the University of Wisconsin, was hired to develop a program at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1964. The Free Speech Movement and antiwar activities at U. C. Berkeley had a profound effect on Lipofsky and are reflected in some of the messages incorporated in the artist’s early work, such as “I Only Want Peace” from 1969, which we displayed in our 2014-15 exhibition, \"Studio Glass: The Art of Marvin Lipofsky, Richard Marquis, John Lewis, and Elin Christopherson.\"  “Marvin Lipofsky: International Studio Glass” is located pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/MarvinLipofsky",
