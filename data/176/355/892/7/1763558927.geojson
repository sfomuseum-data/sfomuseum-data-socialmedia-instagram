Although our Video Arts gallery is currently closed, we’re featuring online the work of four artists to share stories of meaningful connections—a shy teen’s victory over self-consciousness in his search for acceptance; the resilience of human connection in the face of memory loss; the courage of a young boy to reach out to the object of his affection; and a reminder from the heart of New York’s Greenwich Village that community is often found in unlikely places.  Give yourself a few minutes and watch the videos here: http://bit.ly/VideoArts",
