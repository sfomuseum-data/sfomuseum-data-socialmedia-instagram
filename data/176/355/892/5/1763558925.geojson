Designed by Pierre-Antoine Mongin (1761–1827), it depicts many famous tourist attractions in Switzerland, such as Staubbach Falls and the village of Bern. The wallpaper requires 1,024 woodblocks and 150 colors for a total of 16 lengths. Zuber continues to offer this scenic paper today.  “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” is online at: http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
