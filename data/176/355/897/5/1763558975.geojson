        "body": "In her series, “Blue is Not the Sky”, Paula Riff explores the elements of color, form, and design through the use of cameraless and experimental photography techniques. Using the slow and often arduous processes of gum bichromate and cyanotype, Riff produces unique analog prints that imagine the universe through the world of abstraction. Riff pushes back against photography’s ability to reproduce reality. She uses the medium to produce works that embrace the fundamental elements of design while giving homage to the beauty and simplicity of abstraction.  “Blue Is Not The Sky” by #PaulaRiff (@paulariffphotography) is online at: https://bit.ly/36OlZSX",
