The flight was flown on a McDonnell Douglas MD-80 piloted by TWA Captain Bill Compton that departed from Kansas City at 1:40pm and landed in St. Louis at 2:45pm.   At midnight, December 2, 2001, employees took down TWA signs and replaced them with American Airlines signs; American Airlines had bought TWA earlier in the year. Did you ever fly on TWA?
