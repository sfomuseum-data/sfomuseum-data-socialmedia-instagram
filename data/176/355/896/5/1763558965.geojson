        "body": "Untitled (Large Variation)” by #AmyEllingson suggests movement and transformation through color, geometry, repetition, scale, and spatial illusion.  Ellingson’s practice is a synergy between digital media and the hand-made object.  Typically, she uses graphics software to create multilayered compositions of great complexity that are translated into physical form using traditional painting media. Here, she has realized her virtual design as a mosaic mural of commanding physical presence.  See “Untitled (Large Variation)” by @AmyEllingsonartist online at: https://bit.ly/3qiMM2L",
