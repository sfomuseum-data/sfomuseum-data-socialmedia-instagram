        "body": "Introduced in 1951, the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation was an enhanced-range, stretched upgrade of the L-049 Constellation and was developed primarily to compete on transatlantic routes with the Douglas DC-6. The cabin was divided into multiple sections to minimize the effect of the long-tube view when looking up from one's seat. With a 100-passenger capacity, the airliner had a range of 4,000 miles and a cruising speed of 300 miles.   The L-1049G Super Constellation variant, introduced into service in 1955 by TWA (Trans World Airways) and Northwest Orient Airlines, was the ultra long-range version of the aircraft and included more powerful Wright turbo-compound engines and a modification to allow the installation of wingtip fuel tanks. Primarily operated on long-haul transoceanic routes, the L-1049G had a superior range of over 5,000 miles.",
