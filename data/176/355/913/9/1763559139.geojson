        "body": "Motorcycling and aviation legend Glenn Hammond Curtiss was born #OnThisDay in 1878. Before turning to aviation, he designed a series of innovative and influential single- and double-cylinder engines for his pioneering motorcycles. In 1903, Curtiss introduced one of the first two-cylinder motorcycle engines, a powerful five-horsepower, V-Twin design that boasted a greater power-to-weight ratio than a comparable single-cylinder engine. With consistent improvements, the engines increased their power output and decreased in weight over the next few years. Curtiss raced extensively to promote the company and garnered numerous records and wins.   After the Curtiss Double Cylinder engine was adapted for use in airships known as dirigibles, he received an order in 1906 from the United States War Department, which stated the Curtiss engines developed “a greater amount of power to the pound than any other known source of energy.”  “Early American Motorcycles” is on view pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall and online - link in bio.",
