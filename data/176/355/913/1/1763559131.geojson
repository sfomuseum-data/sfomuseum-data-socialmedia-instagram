Get a great view of the airfield and check out our exhibition on the 1954 Terminal!  As the airline industry soared to new heights in the late 1940s and 1950s, construction of a new terminal at San Francisco Airport began in 1951. Designed in the International Style, the seven-story building employed an innovative, dual-level layout that separated departures from arrivals. Dedicated roadways streamlined traffic to the terminal, and restaurants and amenities such as the Pancake Palace and International Room filled the bustling passenger areas.   Learn more about the 1954 Terminal online at: http://bit.ly/SFO1954 \u003c-- also via bio.  Or visit in person ðŸ˜· at Sky Terrace starting this Friday at 10am! It's free and will be open to the public.",
