Standing 221 feet tall, the new tower is seismically fitted to withstand a magnitude 8 earthquake and is protected against lightning strikes. The tower cab offers almost 270-degree views of the airfield.   SFO’s air traffic control tower was a partnership between the FAA and the City and County of San Francisco; the City commissioned the construction of the new control tower and base building began in summer 2012, with the FAA taking over in 2015, installing equipment and conducting training and testing.
