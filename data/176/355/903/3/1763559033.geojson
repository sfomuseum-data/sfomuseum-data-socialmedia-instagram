        "body": "Bonnie Jones Moon worked for Pan American World Airways from 1972 to 1989. Of her time with Pan Am, she says she loved “being part of a flight attendant corps that included so many smart, resourceful, funny, educated, sophisticated, dedicated, talented, and committed women and men. I felt so honored to be part of the long heritage that is Pan Am.” One of her most memorable experiences included being on a flight from San Juan to New York, where a passenger, “brought on a paper bag full of crabs and they made their way out the bag during take-off. The crabs fell on the floor and started to crawl around nibbling at people’s feet as the embarrassed passenger tried to gather them all.”   Personal stories are treasures within our collection. We’d like to give a special “Thank you!” to @world_wings_international, an organization of former Pan Am flight attendants, for their donation in 2012 of over 500 member career history questionnaires, each of which shines a unique light on what it meant and means to be a flight attendant.
