This historic first flight of the Boeing 707 was flown by company chief test pilot Tex Johnston, co-pilot Jim Gannet, and flight engineer Tom Layne. Seven minutes after takeoff, weather forced a premature landing at nearby Boeing Field. A seventy-one-minute flight was flown later the same day after the weather had cleared. This aircraft, registered N708PA, was delivered to Pan American World Airways on November 30, 1958.  Image: Pan American World Airways, Boeing 707, 1957. Gift of the Captain John B.
