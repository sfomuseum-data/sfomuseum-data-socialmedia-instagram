        "body": "Art found in ancient sites throughout the Chiapas highlands preserves images of early attire and the oldest symbols utilized in contemporary Mayan weaving. A stone carving from a lintel at the Bonampak temple complex shows one of the most common ancient designs, known today as the cruz or feathered cross. The symbol decorates a long and elaborate huipil worn by Lady K'ab'al Xook, queen of Yaxchil√°n, who is performing a bloodletting ritual with her husband, Shield Jaguar II in the year 709CE. Glyphs on the lintel identify dates along with the king and queen, yet do not give a name or interpretation of the cruz symbol. While the true meaning of the feathered cross is lost to time, its design survives in weaving as a representation of Mayan antiquity.
