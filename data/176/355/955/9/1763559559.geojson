        "body": "The Shona comprise the largest Indigenous group in Zimbabwe. Shona sculptors often draw inspiration from dreams in which ancestral spirits speak to them. Carvers then “release the spirit in the stone.” Spirits revealed in the sculpture may also guide the carving process. In addition to ancestral spirits, spirits exist in the form of all matter—from stone to water and trees. Other common themes in stone sculpture include the family, mother and child, animals, and abstract or whimsical forms.
