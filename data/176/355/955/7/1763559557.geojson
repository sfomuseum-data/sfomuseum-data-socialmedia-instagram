        "body": "Pennsylvania Central Airlines changed its name to Capital Airlines in 1948. The airline established its hub at Washington D.C., the nationâ€™s capital, and it introduced the first sustained low-fare coach service in the United States. Capital used its company name as a territorial signifier to identify with the capital city. For its brand, a stylized eagle symbol was developed with a rigid, airplane-like wing that blended the natural with the mechanical. The eagle flew under a constellation of stars arrayed like destinations on a route map. In 1961, Capital was absorbed by United Air Lines.",
