The initial “Love Bird” service out of Dallas Love Field offered twelve daily round-trip flights from Dallas to Houston and six round-trip flights from Dallas to San Antonio on Boeing 737-200s with $20 one-way fares. Since starting service, Southwest has the distinction of almost exclusively operating the Boeing 737 family, except for a brief period when the airline operated Boeing 727s. Have you ever flown on Southwest Airlines?",
