        "body": "Pacific Air Transport (PAT) was founded in 1926 by Vern C. Gorst, a transportation-minded entrepreneur with ties to the Pacific Northwest and California. Foreseeing the potential economic opportunities in airmail routes, PAT bid on and won Airmail Route CAM 8, which ran between Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles, California. PAT flew two-passenger Ryan M-1 mail planes with passengers often packed in with mail sacks. Pacific Air Transport was acquired by Boeing Air Transport in 1928, yet continued to operate as a separate division retaining its identity. Both companies would become part of United Air Lines in the 1930s.  Image: Pacific Air Transport postcard, Ryan M-1, 1973. Gift of United Airlines Archives. 2005.008.133",
