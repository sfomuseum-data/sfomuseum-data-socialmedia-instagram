        "body": "In 2005 when Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpaper (@bradburywallpaper) founder Bruce Bradbury retired, Stephen Bauer and his wife Lisa took over the company. Bauer, a gifted illustrator, began apprenticing at Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers in 1982 at the young age of nineteen. Like Bruce, he felt passionate about Victorian design, even as a child. As the company’s artistic director, Bauer scours authentic patterns found in museum and archival collections, factory records, early wallpaper sample books, and period literature to create his artisanal wallpapers.   While briefly attending Cal State Fullerton, Bauer spent more time in the library reading about William Morris than he did in the classroom. He was particularly fond of the nineteenth-century design books reproduced by John and Judy Freeman at the American Life Foundation and reached out to the couple to inquire about potential scholarships in Britain. The Freemans informed Bruce Bradbury about this young man, who spent much of his time drawing period houses and interiors. In 1982, Bruce offered a job to Bauer, who jumped at the opportunity. After relocating from Orange County, he learned color theory and pattern design under Bruce’s tutelage.   Special thank you to Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers for making this exhibition possible. “The Victorian Papered Wall” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/VictorianPaperedWall",
