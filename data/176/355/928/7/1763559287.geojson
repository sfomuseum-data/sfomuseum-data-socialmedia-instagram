        "body": "Braniff International Airways declared 1965 as “The End of the Plain Plane” after they hired advertising executive Mary Wells Lawrence (b. 1928) to rebrand the airline. Braniff and Lawrence commissioned architect and designer Alexander Girard (1907–93) to color coordinate everything from aircraft interiors to sugar packets, and they hired Italian fashion designer Emilio Pucci (1914–92) to overhaul the airline’s uniforms. From 1965–74, Pucci created multiple series of wild, mix-and-match, “non-uniform” uniforms for Braniff in a variety of vivid colors and bold patterns that revolutionized airline fashion. Pucci’s 1968 “Classic Collection” featured a long-sleeve dress in pale pink or plum Trevira polyester and wool, with matching gloves, leggings, and leather pumps. A geometric-patterned, pink and yellow Vivara scarf added a splash of color, while a silver vinyl serving apron and belt with faux jewel ends reminded passengers of the ongoing Space Race.   \"Flight Patterns\" is on display post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: http://bit.ly/FlightPatternsSFOM",
