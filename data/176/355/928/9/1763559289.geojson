Each piece starts with a carefully curated collection of these mixed media. Doongarwal then creates her collages by tearing and layering prints and further embellishing them with paint, stamps, and fabric. Every conceptual portrait takes on a new, abstract identity and tells a unique story by creating visual links to history and contemporary reality. Her work explores the varying relationships between the past and popular culture by referencing social issues such as racism, gender inequality, and immigration.  “Identity” by Nimisha Doongarwal is on display pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/3HAiyAX",
