        "body": "Boeing adopted the two-engine, widebody concept with its 777 airliner, which was introduced on June 7, 1995, with United Airlines. The 777 was a joint project between Boeing and eight major airlines including United, ANA (All Nippon Airways), British Airways, and Japan Airlines. The program called “Working Together” used computer-aided three-dimensional interactive applications, making the 777 the first completely digitally designed airplane. The first Boeing aircraft to incorporate fly-by-wire controls, the 777 is also the first to use a fiber optic avionics network on a commercial airliner.  The world’s largest twin jet, it has the capacity to seat between 317 and 396 passengers in a two class configuration and has a range of 6,000 to 8,400 miles. With a cruising speed of 554 mph, some variations of the 777 can operate on long-haul polar routes.  Have you ever flown on a Boeing 777?",
