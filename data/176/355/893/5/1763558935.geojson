And after all, that's what this is all about. It's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power — it's about giving those young people out there in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias, hope. You gotta give them hope.“ - Harvey Bernard Milk (1930–78), visionary human rights leader, groundbreaking political luminary, and seminal figure of the LGBTQ rights movement.
