Milburn and the largest commercial airplane when delivered in 1935, only three Martin M-130 flying boats were built. They were named \"Hawaii Clipper\", \"Philippine Clipper\", and \"China Clipper\". When the \"China Clipper\" inaugurated service to Asia, the name became synonymous in the public’s mind with all of Pan American’s Pacific flying boats. Its distinguishing characteristics were sleek lines and the stabilizing seawings, or “sponsons,” at the waterline braced by cross struts.
