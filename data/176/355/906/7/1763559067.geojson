They were perfectly suited to the increasingly complicated hairstyles of the ensuing decades, which required women to visit salons on a weekly basis to have their hair “set.” In an attempt to mimic the salon experience at home, portable bonnet hair dryers, which had a shower-cap style headpiece attached to a hose and motor, debuted in the early 1950s.   See “Hair Style” on display, post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 or online - link in bio.",
