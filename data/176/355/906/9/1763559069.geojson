From a stop-motion animated ode to a father’s lasting impact and a tribute to family ties and Northern Paiute traditions, to a humorous glimpse of family dynamics within a car trip and a poetic tribute to a mother’s love for her distant son, today’s filmmakers bring us stories that inspire and enlighten.  Our screening room may still be closed, but you can watch the films online at: http://bit.ly/VideoArts",
