The Spruce Goose was one of the largest planes ever constructed and was the largest wooden plane ever built. It was intended as a wartime aircraft to move troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean. On November 2, 1947, off the coast of San Pedro, California, the Hughes H-4 Hercules took off and covered only a mile, at an altitude of 70 feet. The only one of its kind and only flown the one time, the prototype now resides on display in the Evergreen Aviation Museum in Oregon.  Image: Spruce Goose, 1947. Gift of Frank A.
