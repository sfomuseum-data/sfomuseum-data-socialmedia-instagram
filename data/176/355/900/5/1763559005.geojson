        "body": "Do you ever wonder how animals traveled in the past? In the 1950s, Pan American was one of the many airlines that carried animals from all over the world to their destinations. “Pan American stewardess Patti Jordan takes time out from her regular duties to feed five little passengers that arrived in San Francisco from their native home on the Falkland Islands. The penguins were fed, cooled in a tub of water and put aboard a Clipper for the last leg of their journey to Honolulu. They were consigned to the Honolulu Zoo.” (Text from an accompanying press release.)  Image: Pan American World Airways, Pacific - Alaska Division, 1950s. Gift of William E. Talbott. 2012.151.260",
