        "body": "Our newest exhibition, “Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll” is on display now in Terminal 2 and online. Instrumental surf music swept across the United States like a great sonic wave during the early 1960s. Energetic and melodic with little or no vocal accompaniment, instrumental surf music originated in Southern California along with a booming interest in surfing and the subsequent pop-cultural craze. The music was loud and dynamic, driven by Fender guitars and a powerful rhythm section. The genre was revived in the early 1980s and spread worldwide in the 1990s, and today there are active surf and instrumental scenes throughout the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Australia, Japan, and across Europe.  Featuring 12 guitars played by the great instrumental surf rock hitmakers, this exhibition is a showcase of their talent.   See “Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll” online at: http://bit.ly/InstrumentalSurf",
