In 2008, we presented “Young Eyes on the Skies: The Golden Age of Aviation Toys” which featured aviation toys from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, made of cast iron, pressed steel and tin. The toys presented in this exhibition helped to create the first \"air-minded\" generation. Do you remember this exhibition?",
