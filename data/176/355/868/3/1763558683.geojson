        "body": "Growing up outside of San Francisco in the East Bay suburb of Walnut Creek during the 1950s and ‘60s, Mimi Plumb was raised amidst a changing landscape. Driven by a widespread push towards suburban living, the area’s rolling hills transformed into subdivisions as housing developments swept through the Contra Costa countryside. While a student of photography at the San Francisco Art Institute in the 1970s, Plumb revisited her childhood stomping grounds with a 35mm camera and the visual sensibilities of someone who shared a distinct, personal relationship with the landscape. Documenting the suburbs and their inhabitants, she made photographs that recalled the mood and memories of her early years living in these suburban communities.  See \"What is Remembered\" by Mimi Plumb on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2w46qqg",
