        "body": "The Douglas DC-6 was initially conceived of as a military transport but its design was changed to a civilian airliner following the end of World War II. It was fundamentally an updated, enlarged, and pressurized DC-4 built to compete with the Lockheed L-049 Constellation. Introduced by United Air Lines and American Airlines in 1946, it was the first new American-designed airliner to operate during the postwar years.   Later variants had a longer fuselage, increased range, and higher weight capabilities, and include the DC-6A cargo-liner, the DC-6B passenger-liner, and the convertible cargo/passenger DC-6C. The passenger versions could feature luxuriously appointed cabin interiors with options for a lounge in the tail section and sleeper berth accommodations. One of the most economical large propliners to operate during the postwar period and beyond, over 700 were eventually built and added to airline fleets worldwide.",
