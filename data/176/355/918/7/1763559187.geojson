Fronted by surf music historian John Blair (b. 1947), Jon \u0026 The Nightriders followed with Surf Beat ’80 and continued the group’s dedication to reviving the traditional emotion and tone of instrumental surf music. Somewhat surprisingly, surf music was welcomed amidst the punk, garage, and new wave movements in such diverse venues as the historic Whisky A Go-Go on Hollywood’s Sunset Strip, the Orange County amusement park Knott’s Berry Farm, and the Los Angeles punk-rock-haven Madame Wong’s West.  See more of “Surf’s Up! Instrumental Rock ‘n’ Roll,” online, where you can also find a link to the exhibition playlist on Spotify. Link in bio.",
