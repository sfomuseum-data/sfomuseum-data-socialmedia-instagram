        "body": "While the British Invasion rocked the United States in the mid 1960s, “Ventures-mania” swept through Japan, where The Ventures outsold The Beatles in record sales by approximately two-to-one. In all, The Ventures placed thirty-seven albums in the Japanese charts and sold more than forty million records in that country alone. The Ventures even had their own signature model Mosrite guitar. The Mosrite Ventures Mk 5 guitar shown here is from a matching set of three guitars made for the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) show in 1966 and was played by Don Wilson while on tour in Mexico and Japan that year.",
