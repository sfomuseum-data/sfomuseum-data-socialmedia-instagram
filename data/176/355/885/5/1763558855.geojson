        "body": "The evolution of motorcycling dates to the bicycling craze of the late-1800s. Bicycle racers found they could pedal with less effort in the slipstream created behind another racer, a \"pacer,\" and then use their reserve energy to pass that rider. As it became increasingly hard to find pacers who agreed not to win, motorized pacing machines known as motor-pacers filled the niche created by bicycle racing. Soon after, motor-pacers raced against themselves in dedicated events.   “Early American Motorcycles” is on view pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall and online at sfomuseum.org.",
