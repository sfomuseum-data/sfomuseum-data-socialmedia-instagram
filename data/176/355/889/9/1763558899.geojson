Initially used exclusively on transpacific flights, Sleeperettes featured scientifically engineered comfort for long haul flights and could be adjusted for just relaxing or to let passengers lie down and sleep. The seats could also be turned around for passengers to engage in conversations or play games together.   Image: Pan American World Airways brochure, Sleeperette, 1947. Gift of Jon E.
