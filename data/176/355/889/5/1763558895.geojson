The class took place during the 2020 spring semester while the shelter-in-place occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As students adjusted to schooling from home, their artwork addressed the loss of in-person connection. A spirit of adaptation, invention, and finding new ways to retain a sense of community became the foundation of the class.   “Alternative Process” is online at: https://bit.ly/34x2Vc9",
