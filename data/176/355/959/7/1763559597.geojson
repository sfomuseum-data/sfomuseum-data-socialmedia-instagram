        "body": "New exhibition alert! Zimbabwe boasts an abundance of stone deposits throughout the country and a unique artistic tradition of stone carving. Many of the sculptures in this exhibition are made from one of two locally sourced stones—opal stone or springstone. Each sculpture expresses the artist’s imagination and ingenuity. The selected work on exhibition reflects the diversity of approaches by twenty-first century artists working in the tradition of Zimbabwean stone sculpture.  See \"Stone Sculpture of Zimbabwe\" on display pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/ZimbabweSculpture",
