        "body": "“Texas-Mexican Border Music Vol. 17, The First Women Duets” features some of the most famous early female duets, including the Mendoza Sisters, Hermanas Padilla, and Hermanas Huerta. Prior to the 1930s, women’s involvement in Mexican music primarily centered on the vaudeville theater stage. During the 1920s, the first female vocal duets appeared. In North America, the Hermanas Padilla from Los Angeles, who began performing in the 1930s, became the first female vocal duet to achieve great acclaim. As Chris Strachwitz explains, “Sisters Margarita and María Padilla sang mostly ranchera-type songs, but were probably also influenced by the sound of the very popular Andrews Sisters. The Padilla sisters pioneered a vocal style that widely influenced ranchera singing and created a demand for other female vocal duets.” \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
