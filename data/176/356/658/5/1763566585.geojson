A prolific songwriter, he recorded nearly two-hundred songs during his career, which began in the 1940s and ended in the early 1980s. Hopkins inspired Chris Strachwitz to start his Arhoolie record label. In 1959, Strachwitz traveled to Houston, Texas, where he saw Hopkins perform in an informal beer joint and was struck by his improvised lyrics and spontaneous exchange with the audience. Arhoolie would release its first recording of Hopkins in 1968.  A number of musicians are featured on this compilation including Clifton Chenier, Mercy Dee, Fred McDowell, and K.C. Douglas. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
