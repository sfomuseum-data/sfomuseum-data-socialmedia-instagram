        "body": "Lydia Mendoza (1916–2007), the first true star of Tejano music, nicknamed “La Alondra de la Frontera” (Lark of the Border), was born in Houston to Mexican parents who fled the Mexican Revolution for South Texas. She began singing and playing the guitar in the family group to earn income, performing for tips at restaurants, open markets, and at parties. In 1928, her father responded to an advertisement placed in a newspaper by Okeh Records searching for local talent. The Mendoza family was paid $140 to record a number of songs. In the 1930s, Mendoza began performing on the radio for $3.50 per week after winning an amateur competition on the program La Voz Latina. In 1934, Mendoza recorded her most famous ballad, “Mal Hombre” (Bad Man). Many of her songs explore dark themes of heartbreak and suffering. Her fervent vocals accompanied by her twelve-string guitar have long captivated audiences in Texas and elsewhere in Spanish-speaking America. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie . . .",
