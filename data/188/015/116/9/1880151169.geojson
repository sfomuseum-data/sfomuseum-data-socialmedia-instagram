A massive and luxurious flying boat, the Boeing 314 was called a “flying hotel” by journalists of the day. Pan American ordered six of the original model, and six more B314A variants. The Boeing 314 was introduced to Pan American's Pacific Division and used to open its Atlantic service in 1939. Designed by Wellwood E. Beall, the 314 distinguished itself by sheer size, three vertical stabilizers on its tail, and cantilevered seawings that doubled as fuel tanks. A flight crew of up to ten was required to operate the \"Super Clipper.\"",
