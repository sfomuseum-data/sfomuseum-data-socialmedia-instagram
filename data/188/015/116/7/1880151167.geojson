Introduced 53 years ago, the Boeing 747 created a whole new category of airliner, the wide-body jet. Nicknamed the \"Queen of the Skies,\" the 747 completely revolutionized the airline industry, making high-volume passenger runs on the longest international and intercontinental routes possible. First flown in 1969 and launched into service in January 1970 with Pan American World Airways, the Boeing 747-100 could seat ten abreast and had the capacity to seat up 450 passengers in a three class configuration.
