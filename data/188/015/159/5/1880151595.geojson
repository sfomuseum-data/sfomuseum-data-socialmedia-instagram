        "body": "In 1911, Harriet Quimby became the first woman in the United States to earn a pilot’s license. Born in Michigan, she moved to San Francisco as a teenager and wrote for several San Francisco newspapers, as well as Leslie's Illustrated Weekly. Trained by aviator André Houpert (1886–1963) at the Moisant Aviation School in New York in 1911, she earned her license shortly after and toured with the Moisant exhibition team. In 1912, she became the first woman to cross the English Channel in an airplane. Quimby was also the spokesperson for Vin Fiz, a grape-flavored beverage, and appeared in numerous advertisements for the drink dressed in a distinctive purple aviator uniform of her own design.   “First Flights: Early Women Aviators and their Aircraft” is on display post-security in Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3wzDwfL",
