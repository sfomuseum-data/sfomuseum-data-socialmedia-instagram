        "body": "The sculpting process for Shona artists starts by locating a stone and excavating it before sketching a rough shape in charcoal. The sculptor then begins to chip away at the stone using a chisel and hammer. Depending on the size and hardness of the stone, this may take weeks or months. The artist carves the finer details with smaller hand tools and uses a rasp to smooth the sculpture, followed by finer sandpaper. The stone is then washed smooth and heated by either open flames or a blow torch. This process begins to reveal the stone’s natural color, from emerald green to ebony. Heating the stone also prepares its porous surface for waxing. While still hot, the sculpture is polished with beeswax or carnauba plant wax. Several layers of wax are applied as the sculpture gradually cools. Once cooled, the sculpture’s waxed surface is hand buffed with rags until it displays its rich color and high sheen.
