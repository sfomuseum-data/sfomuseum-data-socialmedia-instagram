Lyon apprenticed at Gabriel Moulin Studio, and studied photography under Ansel Adams, Will Connell, and Edward Kaminski. Lyon photographed the transformation of his treasured hometown into a center for optimism, prosperity, and growth after World War II.   Lyon’s photographs are in the collection of numerous Bay Area museums, and a selection may also be seen in our exhibition of his work, “San Francisco Yesterday 1948-1958”, which we featured in 2013: https://bit.ly/3L9i72z",
