Our conservators performed a thorough assessment of the DC-8 model and developed a plan to address the model’s condition problems. First, the model was thoroughly cleaned. Then conservators were able to address the numerous original components of the model that had detached. These included interior bulkheads, windows, parts of figurines, and sections of furniture. Conservators found the original locations of the detached components and reattached them with adhesive. In some cases, an original segment of a passenger figurine, such as an arm or leg, had detached and could not be found. A number of furniture pieces were also missing, including an entire row of three seats. Because the figures of the passengers were used multiple times in the interior, it was possible to take molds from intact figures in order to recreate the lost pieces on other figures. The missing pieces were then cast in plaster, attached to the original figures or seats, and painted to match the color scheme.
