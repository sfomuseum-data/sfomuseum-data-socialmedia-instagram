Based on the Fairchild FC-2 but nearly five feet longer, which allowed for eight passengers instead of four, the Fairchild 71 was powered by a Pratt and Whitney Wasp with 420 horsepower. This rare photo of NC9726 was taken shortly after the aircraft was delivered to Pan American; it was then transferred to the PAA subsidiary airline Mexicana de Aviacion. Almost 100 Fairchild 71s were built with six airframes delivered to Pan American.   #AvGeek #PanAm #Fairchild71  photograph: Pan American Airways, Fairchild 71; c. 1929 Transfer from San Francisco International Airport 1993.03.17",
