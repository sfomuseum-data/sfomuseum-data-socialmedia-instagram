        "body": "American soprano Leontyne Price (b. 1927) is beloved for her extraordinary voice and radiant charm. Born in Laurel, Mississippi, Price is an internationally renowned opera performer, concert singer, and Grammy Award-winning recording artist. Price debuted on the stage of a major opera house in September 1957 during a stunning performance as Madame Lidoine in the San Francisco Opera production of French composer Francis Jean Marcel Poulenc's (1899–1963) 𝘋𝘪𝘢𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘶𝘦𝘴 𝘥𝘦𝘴 𝘊𝘢𝘳𝘮é𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘴 In October, Price sang Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi’s (1813–1901) 𝘈𝘪𝘥𝘢 for the first time in San Francisco, a role that she practiced in the late 1940s as a student at The Julliard School in New York. 𝘈𝘪𝘥𝘢 became one of Price’s famed operas in San Francisco and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. When she sang at Teatro alla Scala, the legendary opera house in Milan, Italy, for the first time in 1960, Price made her debut with 𝘈𝘪𝘥𝘢. She rescued a San Francisco Opera production of 𝘈𝘪𝘥𝘢 on November 18, 1981, as a last-minute stand-in, and then returned in 1984 for four nights of 𝘈𝘪𝘥𝘢—the final performances of her famous role in San Francisco.
