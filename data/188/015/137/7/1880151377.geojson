        "body": "Initially for temporary publicity, in 1969, Pacific Southwest Airlines or PSA began painting smiles on the nose of its aircraft. They were quickly embraced by passengers and the public and remained as the most recognizable symbol of the airline. In 1970, PSA introduced a form-fitting polyester princess-line dress with a matching jacket, complemented by either a heart-shaped hat or dome-style hat and a choice of boots or pumps. According to the company’s 1970 Annual Report, “The eye-catching pink and apricot color combination was chosen to flatter the fresh and youthful “California Look” of PSA’s beautiful stewardesses while the futuristic style reflects the forward-looking philosophy of the airline.” In 1972, the uniform was updated with several minor color changes and a swirl pattern on the front of the dress and jacket.  In 1986, USAir, driven by other mergers taking place in the aviation industry, (Western airlines was purchased by Delta Air Lines and AirCal was bought by American Airlines) acquired PSA. PSA's last flight was on April 8, 1988.",
