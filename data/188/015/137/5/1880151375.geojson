        "body": "Our newest exhibition “More than a Meal: Airline Meal Service Sets, 1960s–80s” is now on display!  During the early years of commercial flight, the nourishment and hydration needs of passengers became a primary focus for nascent airlines. To provide a restaurant-style inflight dining experience, airlines also considered the tableware comprising the meal service set. They carefully conceived their chinaware, flatware, and glassware for presentation, utilization, storage, and durability. Manufacturers often created tableware bearing the airline’s service mark or logo, as well as unique patterns related to national origin, destination, or service promotions. This exhibition presents eight airline meal service sets from the 1960s to the 1980s, along with menus and images of inflight meal services from the time.  “More than a Meal: Airline Meal Service Sets, 1960s–80s” is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/AirlineMealSets",
