        "body": "Marguerite Wildenhain (1896–1985) was an internationally renowned studio potter who influenced generations of ceramicists. Born in Lyons, France, of English, German, and Jewish descent, she briefly studied drawing and sculpture at the Berlin School of Fine and Applied Arts. Dissatisfied with school, Wildenhain left and designed ceramic wares for a porcelain company in Rudolstadt, Germany, where she was fascinated by the factory’s potters. In 1919, Wildenhain enrolled in the inaugural year of instruction at the legendary Bauhaus in nearby Weimar. She studied sculpture under master potters Gerhard Marcks (1889–1981) and Max Krehan (1875–1925), and after a seven-year apprenticeship-in-residence, she became the first woman in Germany to achieve master potter status.
