        "body": "During the 1990s, Qantas operated a large fleet of the Boeing 747-400 widebody airliner, which was introduced in 1989. With a range of more than seven-thousand miles and a capacity of just over four-hundred passengers, the aircraft was ideal for flying large numbers of business travelers and tourists swiftly and in high comfort between Oceania and North America. One of these was renamed and painted in a special livery in 1994 called Wunala (kangaroo) Dreaming to celebrate the art and culture of the indigenous Yanyuwa people from Australia’s Gulf of Carpentaria.  On 747 flights, Qantas offered three levels of service—first class, business class, and economy class. In first class, the airline offered wide, comfortable, fully-reclining seats and premium meal service cuisine on fine bone china tableware produced by Wedgwood of England.
