        "body": "In “On the Air” by Lewis deSoto, one can literally traverse the earth, walking “on the air” and tracing a path from location to location. Different aspects of the artwork represent different aspects of traveling. The colored pattern on the lobby floor represents air pressure zones called isobars, or pictures of areas of high and low pressure that occur in the atmosphere. They are made of specially mixed colors of terrazzo that were poured onsite. Brass lines represent the edges of the continents and round medallions are international airports. The design is derived from the diagrams that pilots use to determine the angle of ascent or descent into each airport. The visitor walking on top of the floor at first encounters the pattern of isobars, then sees the “touchdown” points for airplanes around the world.   See “On the Air” by Lewis deSoto, located pre-security, on the arrivals level of the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/3gtsljn",
