Each sculpture expresses the artist’s imagination and ingenuity. Obert Mukumbi’s brother Kennedy Musekiwa (b. 1962), an accomplished sculptor, encouraged him to work in stone at the young age of twelve to express his feelings and earn a respectable living. He gained further training from sculptor Richard Magwenzi.   See \"Stone Sculpture of Zimbabwe\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/ZimbabweSculpture",
