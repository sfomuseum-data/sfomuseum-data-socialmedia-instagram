        "body": "Happy Halloween! Do you remember this “spooktacular” exhibition? In 2016, we presented “The Mysterious Talking Board: Ouija and Beyond” featuring over 100 historical Ouija boards spanning over 75 years. Also called a talking board, Ouija boards have their roots in Spiritualism, a belief in the ability of the dead to communicate with the living. In 1890, Charles Kennard formed the Kennard Novelty Company to exclusively produce talking boards. Allegedly, he sought guidance from the board in naming it, and it replied “Ouija,” which the board explained, meant good luck.  The public turned to talking boards for a variety of reasons. Some claimed that spirits dictated entire books to them via the Ouija board. Others turned to talking boards to seek advice about their love lives or for guidance during troubled times. Have you ever played with a Ouija board? http://bit.ly/2s7zLzU   G O O D B Y E",
