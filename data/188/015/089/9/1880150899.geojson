        "body": "Our newest exhibition, “Recollections… from the Unknown Museum” is now on display in Terminal 2! An “exploration into America’s brain,” the Unknown Museum was founded by artist, curator, and archivist Mickey McGowan (b. 1946) and artist Dickens “44” Bascom (b. 1944) in a former automotive radiator shop at 39 Corte Madera Avenue in Mill Valley. McGowan and Bascom created art and installations in a singular, large room that allowed for mass assemblages and the “assault of the objects” on one’s senses. According to McGowan, “curating the museum allowed me to present my ‘two-cents-worth’ reactions to postwar American culture, its fads, trends, joys, and ‘important’ moments.” Formally opened in December 1974, the Unknown Museum became a center of local creativity, rotating its own exhibitions, displaying the work of other artists, and hosting concerts and themed events.  The Unknown Museum continues as a private museum and lending archives. This exhibition presents a sampling of the fantastic art and object installations from various locations of the Unknown Museum.
