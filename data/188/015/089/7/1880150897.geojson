Pita danced professionally before becoming a choreographer in 2003. Often referred to as the “David Lynch of dance,” he choreographed “”The Metamorphosis,” an adaptation of Franz Kafka’s short story, in 2011 for the Royal Opera House. “”Björk Ballet is”” his second work for San Francisco Ballet, following “”Salome”” (2017), which was loosely based on the biblical story of Salome, who receives John the Baptist’s head on a platter.  Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
