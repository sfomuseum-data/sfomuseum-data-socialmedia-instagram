        "body": "Following the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act, in 1979 Allegheny Airways changed its name to US Air. In the next decade, US Air acquired Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) and Piedmont Airlines. In the 1990s, through these acquisitions, the airline became one of the largest in the world and expanded its service to various European cities. The airline again changed its name to US Airways in 1997. Due to the September 11, 2001, attacks, the airline experienced financial downturn following the temporary closure of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The next year, the airline filed for bankruptcy for the first time. After filing for bankruptcy for a second time, the airline merged with America West Airlines in 2005. In 2013, American Airlines and US Airways agreed to a merger. The final US Airways flight took off from SFO to Philadelphia on October 17, 2015.",
