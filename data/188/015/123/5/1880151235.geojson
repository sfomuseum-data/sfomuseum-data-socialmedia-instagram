        "body": "Born on May 22, 1930, in Woodmere, New York, Harvey Milk was the first openly gay person to be elected into office in California. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1951 and served aboard the submarine rescue ship USS Kittiwake as a diving officer prior to his transfer to serve as a diving instructor at Naval Base San Diego. In 1955, he resigned at the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade) after being officially questioned about his sexual orientation. Milk moved to San Francisco in 1972 and became the first openly gay elected official in California history in 1977, when he was elected onto the San Francisco Board of Supervisors representing District 6, covering the Castro neighborhood.
