The Stratoliner was the first commercial airliner put into service to have a pressurized cabin. Named for its ability to cruise near the stratosphere, the airliner had a circular cross-section, tear-drop-shaped fuselage to handle the stresses of pressurization. Only ten were produced: one prototype, five for TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air), three for Pan American, and one for Howard Hughes. The airline touted its quietness, speed, and advanced capability of flying above bad weather and turbulence.",
