The series is a personal inquiry and a poetic interpretation of place across multiple photographic formats. Orvik uses nineteenth-century wet plate collodion processes on metal and glass plates, traditional black and white and color film, as well as digital formats. By incorporating historic photographic processes into her contemporary imagery, Orvik considers our present in relation to the city’s past.   See “Geneva” by Kari Orvik on display in the Ruth Kadish Gallery, which is located in the post-security connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3MjrKM8",
