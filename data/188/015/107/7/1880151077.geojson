        "body": "Lambaréné in Gabon where German physician Albert Schweitzer (1875–1965) founded a hospital in 1913. A musical score by the same name is based on Schweitzer’s practice of playing the music of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) and other European composers on a pedal piano amidst the Central African setting. French composers Pierre Akendengue and Hughes de Courson skillfully interwove African rhythms with extended passages from various Bach compositions. This captivating musical fusion provided inspiration for Caniparoli’s choreography. He combined classical ballet movements with layers of African dance movement, creating a seamless integration of the two styles. To ensure the authenticity of the African components, he enlisted the help of West African dance specialists Zakariya Sao Diouf and Naomi Gedo Johnson-Washington who worked in close collaboration with Caniparoli and San Francisco Ballet dancers.  Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
