        "body": "From its humble beginnings in 1927, with one airmail contract to Cuba and a single leased plane, Pan American Airways rapidly expanded in the 1930s under the leadership of Juan T. Trippe as it pioneered a worldwide overseas route system that included the Caribbean, South America, China, New Zealand, and Europe. By the 1940s, the airline rebranded itself as Pan American World Airways to reflect its global identity.   In 1958, the airline became the first airline to launch Boeing 707 jet service to Europe. Several years later, the airline introduced the “President” pattern meal service set for its first-class international jet service. Noritake of Japan created the ceramic dinnerware featuring an eagle with three gold stars above its head and ten gold stars under its spread wings. A blue line adorned the rims. The eagle design was replicated on the glasses. The flatware was produced by the International Silver Company with Pan American’s jet-age globe logo on the handle of each piece.   “More than a Meal: Airline Meal Service Sets, 1960s–80s” is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/AirlineMealSets",
