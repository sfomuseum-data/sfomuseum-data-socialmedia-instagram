        "body": "The Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco was commissioned #onthisday in 1940. As the “Guardians of the Golden Gate,” these dedicated officers and enlisted personnel are the ever-vigilant eyes in the sky. Their command and capabilities in aerial search and rescue and homeland security personify the Coast Guard motto Semper Paratus (Always Ready).   San Francisco Airport provided 20.53 acres at the mouth of its new man-made seaplane harbor for the Air Station site. In exchange, the federal government dredged and maintained the harbor and its channel to the bay. With a hangar, barracks, and a ramp, the new station was dedicated on February 15, 1941. Have you ever seen the Coast Guard building at SFO?",
