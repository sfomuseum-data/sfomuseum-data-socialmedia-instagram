        "body": "Happy birthday to the late Wayne Thiebaud, who passed last year at the age of 101. Thiebaud was born on this day in 1920 in Mesa, Arizona. In the early 1960s, Thiebaud was acclaimed as one of the defining practitioners of Pop Art and continues to be considered one of California’s most important and influential artists. In the late 1970s, the artist concentrated on a series of San Francisco cityscapes that became a signature theme. Created from a combination of direct observation and memory, these paintings present a dizzying perspective of San Francisco’s extraordinary topography.
