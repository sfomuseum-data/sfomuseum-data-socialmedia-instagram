The thirty-two atolls that make up the country are stretched between the Coordinated Universal Time +12, +13, and +14 time zones.   In 1939, the S.S. North Haven, operated by Pan American Airways, arrived on Canton Island, part of the Republic of Kiribati, to construct an airbase for Pan American, and by 1940, it was ready for operation. Pan American used Canton Island as a stop on its routes from California to Fiji and Auckland, New Zealand.   Do you have anything fun planned this evening to ring in the new year?",
