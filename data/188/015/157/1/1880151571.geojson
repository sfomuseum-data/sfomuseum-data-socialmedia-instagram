She learned to fly at the Moisant Aviation School in New York and afterward became the demonstration pilot for the Bleriot monoplanes built by the Moisant Company under license at this time. She became the first woman aviator to demonstrate an aircraft—and the first person to demonstrate a monoplane—to the U.S. government when she flew a Moisant/Bleriot for the U.S. Army at College Park, Maryland, in 1912.   “First Flights: Early Women Aviators and their Aircraft” is on display post-security in Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3wzDwfL",
