        "body": "Pacific Air Lines began as a business endeavor to train pilots during World War II. Founded by Hollywood and Broadway agent and producer Leland Hayward and TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air) board of directors member John Howard Connelly, and financed by Hollywood actors and executives, including James Stewart and Darryl Zanuck, the airline began commercial commuter passenger operations as Southwest Airways in 1946. Based in San Francisco, the airline proudly promoted itself as serving more California cities than any other scheduled airline.  In 1958, the carrier rebranded itself as Pacific Air Lines, and updated its Navajo-inspired thunderbird logo to a bright and modern, red, white, and blue depiction. In 1965, Pacific began leasing two Boeing 727 jet airliners and placed orders for four more. Adverse publicity from an ill-planned ad campaign that attempted to humorously play off of the flying fears of the public, along with stiff competition on the California corridor from other airlines ultimately led Pacific to seek out a merger with Bonanza Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West in 1968.",
