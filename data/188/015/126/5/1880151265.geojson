        "body": "In the early 1960s, TWA (Trans World Airlines) was operating the 707-320 on the transpolar, route from Los Angeles to Paris. Around the same time, in 1962, TWA opened their iconic terminal, the Trans World Flight Center, designed by Eero Saarinen, at New York New York International Airport, later renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport. By 1969, TWA 707s were flying transpacific routes to Asia.   In 1971, TWA introduced a new group of flight attendant uniforms conceived by Rome-based fashion designer Valentino Garavani. When the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar was introduced in 1972, the airline proclaimed it to be “the next generation of the jet age” and one of the most modern and comfortable airliners in the world.   TWA was purchased by American financier Carl Icahn in the 1980s, though the company struggled in the post airline-deregulation era. The airline filed for bankruptcy for the first time in 1992, for a second time in 1995, and for the last time in 2001. TWA was acquired by American Airlines’ parent company in 2001 and operated its final flight on December 1, 2001.",
