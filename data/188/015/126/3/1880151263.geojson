        "body": "John T. McCoy, aeronautical artist and historian, was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1909. In 1926, as a resident of Clifton, New Jersey, he worked weekends at Curtiss Field, Long Island, New York. Among other tasks, he serviced the soon-to-be-famous “Spirt of St. Louis” and often pulled the propeller through to start the engine for its pilot, Charles A. Lindbergh. Eventually he learned to fly and earned both a commercial pilot’s license and a flight instructor’s rating.  McCoy began his painting career in the early 1930s, painting portraits of private airplanes to finance his flying lessons.   During World War II, McCoy was assigned to the Historical Office of the Army Air Force where he produced “The Pictorial History of the Army Air Force”. In 1962, Pan American World Airways commissioned McCoy to produced eight paintings depicting “Historical First Flights of Pan American Clippers.” Later Pan Am commissioned additional works that included aircraft from its fleet of jet clippers.   Pan American World Airways used McCoy’s watercolors on menus, prints, advertisements, postcards, and other promotional items.
