After World War II, BCPA (British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines) and ANA (Australian National Airways) commenced commercial air services on their branded “Southern Cross Route” between Australia and San Francisco via Fiji and Hawai’i. Through airliner models, promotional items, meal service wares, cabin crew uniforms, and photographs, “Flying the Southern Cross Route” presents a legacy of Australian air service on this long-celebrated route that connects two diverse regions and both hemispheres.  “Flying the Southern Cross Route: Seventy-Five years of Australian Commercial Air Service to North America” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library, located on the departures level of the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/3oyMqFX",
