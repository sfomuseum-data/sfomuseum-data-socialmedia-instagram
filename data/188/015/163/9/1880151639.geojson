        "body": "Northeast Airlines was based in Boston, Massachusetts. Founded in 1931 as Boston-Maine Airways, it operated sporadically for a few months as a Pan American Airways carrier. In 1933, another Boston-Maine Airways was formed under contract with National Airways. Amelia Earhart and Eugene Vidal were among National Airwaysâ€™ cofounders. Its name changed to Northeast Airlines in 1940, and that decade saw Northeast's route service expand into New York and Moncton, New Brunswick.  In 1959, Northeast became one of the first domestic carriers to offer jet service between New York and Miami using Boeing 707s. In 1960, the airline began operating Convair 990s on its routes to Florida. In the mid-1960s, a bright yellow livery was introduced, created by famed Industrial Designer Raymond Loewy. Nicknamed the yellowbirds, it was the airline's final livery. Despite expansion into new destinations, the airline had crippling financial issues. It was acquired by Delta Air Lines in August 1972.",
