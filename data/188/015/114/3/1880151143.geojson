        "body": "This tile shows three cranes flying above waves, with a full moon and two clouds behind them. The cranes and waves are adapted from a Japanese pot that was displayed as a “jardinière” at the International Exhibition in London in 1862. The Minton Archive holds a drawing signed by Christopher Dresser that shifts the motif on the pot to a horizontal format with three cranes flying over stylized waves, along with a cloud and full moon.  See “Japonisme: A Passion for Japan” on display, post-security, in Terminal 2 and online at: https://bit.ly/JaponismeSFO",
