Apollo 8 was in orbit around the moon; the film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" was released and featured an imagined Pan American-operated spacecraft; and Juan Trippe, Pan Am's founder, announced the airline's \"First Moon Flights”\" Club. For the next four years, over 90,000 people signed up for a space trip and received these First Moon Flights Club cards. On the card's back, it declared, \"Pan Am makes the going great: first in Latin America, first on the Atlantic, first on the Pacific, first round the world.\" A letter that came with the card stated: \"Fares are not fully resolved and may be out of this world.”",
