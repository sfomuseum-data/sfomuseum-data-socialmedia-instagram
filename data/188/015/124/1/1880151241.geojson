        "body": "“Continuous City” is an immersive installation that allows travelers to see themselves reflected in San Francisco’s dynamic past and present. The artists curated historic photographs and contemporary architectural elements then recombined them to capture the essence of San Francisco.  The resulting effect is a vibrant and imaginative urban landscape that allows visitors to experience the city’s unique and diverse culture through its architectural history.  The artists wish to dedicate this work in memory of Amy Zimmerman (1960–2021), life partner of Derek Lynch, whose support was invaluable in the development of the proposal for this artwork.  See “Continuous City” by Stacey Carter and Derek Lynch, in the post-security connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 and online at: https://bit.ly/3urXkzL",
