The new twin engine jet was part of Airbus' A300 series which were built to fill airlines' need for wide-body jets to use on short-haul routes. Acquisition of the efficient A300B4 was seen as a way to reduce the number of different aircraft types in Pan American's fleet. Eventually operating twelve of them, in addition to the seven of the smaller A310 models, the airline employed the new Airbus on their Latin American, Atlantic, and European routes. Have you ever flown on an Airbus 300?",
