The Sikorsky S-40 monoplane flying boat airliners were the first to be named “Clipper Ships” by Pan American Airways. The cabins were spacious and luxuriously appointed with mahogany paneling. With a cabin capable of carrying thirty-eight passengers, it was nearly double the capacity of the Consolidated Commodore, the airline’s next largest flying boat. Pan American Airways introduced the aircraft in 1931, piloted by Charles A. Lindbergh on its Miami–Barranquilla route.",
