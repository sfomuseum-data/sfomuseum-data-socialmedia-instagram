        "body": "Japan’s outstanding metallurgy inspired Western silver manufacturers to reconsider their design and production processes. Traditionally, the West valued silver and gold above all other metals. The Japanese, on the other hand, used iron, zinc, bismuth, gold, silver, copper, and bronze. Metalsmiths combined different metals using techniques such as inlay, applied castings, and mechanical fusion.  The sides of this footed dish are intricately worked. The “outer” layer of hexagonal hammering appears torn away to reveal differing patterns beneath. Multi-colored gold butterflies and foliage accent the piece.
