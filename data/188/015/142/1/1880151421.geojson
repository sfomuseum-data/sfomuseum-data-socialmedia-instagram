        "body": "Marvin Lipofsky, a founding member of the American studio glass movement, explored the limits of form and color in glass and helped to elevate the medium to a fine art.  “I wanted a way to work where I wouldn’t just experiment and have a chance of losing everything, because time was precious. I’d be there for just a few days and I wanted to take advantage and get as much as possible out of the process. So, I started using the old molds in the factory…but I adapted them, I changed them. I put things into them, I opened them up, I turned them upside down, I’d cut them apart…Then I’d blow the glass over these forms, which would create other shapes. Anything that pressed into the glass left an impression. Each place that I went when I did this, that impression from that object left a mark, a trace, a history.” —Marvin Lipofsky; Columbia University Center for Oral History, 1988  “Marvin Lipofsky: International Studio Glass” is on view pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/MarvinLipofsky",
