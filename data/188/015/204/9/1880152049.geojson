        "body": "The clock is ticking to catch Toy Story at Twenty! Green army men are a staple of childhood toys, and Toy Story had to be true to the audience’s memories of playing with their own toys. To ensure that the toys’ movements matched their physical limitations, co-creator and supervising animator Pete Docter bolted a pair of sneakers to a board; animators took turns wearing the board and hopping around the studio, analyzing each other’s movements. The same level of care went into studying how the plastic parachutes deployed. “Little green army men can't suddenly move in a way that a kid playing with them wouldn’t picture them moving. They can't just act like human soldiers. When they're alive, they still have to move like toy soldiers.” John Lasseter, director",
