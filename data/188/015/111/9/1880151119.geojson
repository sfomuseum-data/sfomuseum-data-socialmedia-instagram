        "body": "“As far back as I could remember, I've always felt like a boy. I'm the oldest of three siblings, and for a lot of years I identified as a lesbian. Back then I didn't know the word “transgender,\" you know. And then when I explained how I felt to somebody, they said, \"Oh, transgender,\" and I'm like, \"What does that mean?\" So that's how I got to identify as transgender. When I was younger and I looked in the mirror, I saw a boy. And I remember when I came out to my parents, my mother was like, \"I always knew that there was something a little different,\" but she didn't know what.” - Preston, 52, East Haven, CT, 2016  Representations of older transgender people are nearly absent from our culture and those that do exist are often one-dimensional. For over five years (2013–2018), photographer Jess T. Dugan and social worker Vanessa Fabbre traveled throughout the United States creating “To Survive on This Shore: Photographs and Interviews with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Older Adults.”   Each portrait in “To Survive on this Shore” by Jess T. Dugan and Vanessa Fabbre includes a powerful interview with each of the featured individual.   See “To Survive on this Shore” on display in the Ruth Kadish Gallery located in the post-security connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 and online at: https://bit.ly/3ZqwUN4",
