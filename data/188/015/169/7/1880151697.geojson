In 1912, at the age of twenty-one, Katherine Stinson (1891-1977) became only the fourth woman in the United States to obtain a pilot’s certification. Five years later and world-famous, she visited San Francisco for a public flying exhibition at San Bruno’s Tanforan Race Track. The day was December 30th, 1917, and Stinson flew her Curtiss-Stinson JN-4/S-3 Special biplane. Katherine Stinson was one of only a small number of licensed women aviators performing worldwide at this time.
