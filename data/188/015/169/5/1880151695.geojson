        "body": "This is your last week to see “Curiosity \u0026 Discovery: Antique Scientific Instruments!”  The 19th century was full of exciting scientific discoveries. One of the most monumental achievements was the discovery of electromagnetic phenomena. In addition to generating electrical current, the physical properties of electromagnetic induction also drive electric motors. Prior to their practical application, these early motors demonstrated the novel idea that induction could produce a spinning force, such as this rotating wire frame by Daniel Davis, Jr. (1813–87), who was the first commercial maker of electromagnetic instruments in the United States.
