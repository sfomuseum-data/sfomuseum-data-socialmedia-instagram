        "body": "A San Francisco native, Joan Brown (1938-90) was recognized early in her career as a major talent working in the style that became identified as Bay Area Figurative. By the 1970s, Brown developed a personal iconography that combined people, places, and events she had known intimately with symbolic imagery in a style that became identified by critics as California myth-making. This painting refers to a personal journey, set against a San Francisco skyline.  See “The Journey #2” by Joan Brown, located post-security in Terminal 2. https://bit.ly/3LKdizk",
