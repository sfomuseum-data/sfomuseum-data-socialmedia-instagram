        "body": "How many of you take time to review the safety information card once you’ve boarded an airplane? Safety information was provided to passengers dating back to the earliest days of commercial aviation. Up through the postwar era safety information was often printed in pamphlet form like this one from United Air Lines in the 1950s. These were primarily text-based with line drawings. Some airlines also dispersed safety information in a more-durable card form. Yet, not until 1965 did the FAA mandate that the airlines provide each passenger with a printed safety information card. More recent cards are predominantly based on illustrations to ensure that passengers can understand the crucial information it contains regardless of whether they understand the language(s) used on board the aircraft.   Fun fact: federal regulations require printed safety cards to supplement oral briefings, and these cards must contain: (1) Diagrams of, and methods of operating, the emergency exits;  (2) Other instructions necessary for use of emergency equipment; and  (3) No later than June 12, 2005, for Domestic and Flag scheduled passenger-carrying flights, the sentence, “Final assembly of this airplane was completed in [INSERT NAME OF COUNTRY].”   safety information card: United Air Lines; 1953 Gift of Gerald J.
