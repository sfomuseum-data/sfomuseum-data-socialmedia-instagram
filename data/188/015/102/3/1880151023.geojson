        "body": "California Arts \u0026 Architecture began in 1929 as a magazine for residential design featuring a wide range of styles from Tudor to Mediterranean. When it declared bankruptcy in 1938, the magazine was purchased by John Entenza who transformed it into a modernist haven for design. When Charles and Ray Eames relocated to Los Angeles in 1941, they became friends with Entenza. Ray designed twenty-six covers for Arts \u0026 Architecture between 1942 and 1947. Her cover designs highlighted her interest in collage, biomorphic and geometric forms, and pops of color.
