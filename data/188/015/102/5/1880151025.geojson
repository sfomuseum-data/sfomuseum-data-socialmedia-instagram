Originally named Trans-Pacific Airways, the airline specialized in interisland service. In the late 1950s, the airline officially changed their name to Aloha Airlines. The airlineâ€™s livery in the 1970s, bright and colorful, represented the warmth of the tropical Hawaiian Islands. The airline's last flight departed #onthisday in 2008. Did you ever fly on Aloha Airlines?",
