This flight with a seven-man crew, set history as the inaugural scheduled transpacific airmail flight. The route from Alameda terminated in Manila with stops via Hawai’i, Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam. The 2,400 miles from San Francisco to Honolulu represented the world’s greatest water gap along any viable aerial trade route. Midway Island, a coral atoll with a central lagoon and a U.S. territory, lay 1,300 miles northwest of Hawai’i. Tiny Wake Island became the vital link as it broke the 2,690 miles from Midway to Guam into manageable segments.  Our exhibition detailing the entire adventurous endeavor, \"China Clipper\", is online at: http://bit.ly/chinaclipper   You can also read the entire exhibition catalog and watch all three segments of “Clipper Glory” there!",
