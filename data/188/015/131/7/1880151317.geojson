Over the past decade, Peterson has captured cloud- and cityscapes from a familiar yet endlessly enjoyable vantage point: the window seat.  Jason Peterson (b.1968) (@jasonmpeterson) is a Chicago-based artist and art director known for his evocative and high-contrast black-and-white photographs of urban environments.   “More than a Meal: Airline Meal Service Sets, 1960s–80s” is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/AirlineMealSets",
