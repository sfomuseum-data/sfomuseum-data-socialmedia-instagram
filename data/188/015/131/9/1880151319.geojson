        "body": "Our newest exhibition, “San Francisco Opera: A Centennial Celebration” is now on display!  San Francisco Opera has presented renowned operatic performances for one-hundred seasons, drawing international superstars, commissioning exciting new productions, and debuting legendary singers. One of the world’s most complex art forms, opera combines libretto, or the text of a long musical work, with vocal and instrumental music, acting, dance, costuming, wig making, makeup, set construction, prop making, lighting, and audio-visual work. San Francisco Opera debuted on September 26, 1923, with La Bohème by Italian composer Giacomo Puccini (1858–1924) at the Exposition Auditorium (now the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium).  Learn more about San Francisco Opera’s history in our exhibition “San Francisco Opera: A Centennial Celebration” on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/SFOperaCentennial",
