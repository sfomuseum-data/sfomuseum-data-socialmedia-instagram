        "body": "During Spanish colonization, young Filipina women acquired a Western education at convents, orphanages, and schools that were established in cities and provinces throughout the Philippines. Female students learned all manner of needlework, from basic stitches to intricate embroidery. The Spanish influenced embroidery styles as did Chinese immigrants who excelled at handwork. Artisans mastered such an impressive array of styles and techniques that their works garnered praise and earned prizes in competitions from Manila to Madrid.   Early examples of piña exhibit high levels of intricate detail, requiring extreme patience and skill. Today, most fabric is embroidered by artisans in Manila or Lumban, thirty-five miles southeast of the capital city, where entire families often work together as a freelance enterprise. Embroidery designs may take days, weeks, or months to complete depending on the intricacy of the designs.
