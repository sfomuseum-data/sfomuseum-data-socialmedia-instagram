Beachey (1887–1915), considered to be “The World’s Greatest Aviator,” can be seen in this photo performing in in his biplane over the Panama-Pacific International Exposition grounds on Christmas day in 1913. Beginning in 1913, he and other pilots flew over the fairgrounds while it was under construction on Sunday afternoons and special holidays.   A natural flyer, Beachey was the first to perform a loop-the-loop in the United States and his repertoire of heart-stopping stunts made him the leading pioneer of aerial acrobatics. Seeming to be at home in the air, he was also declared “The Man Who Owned the Sky.”   #52Objects #LincolnBeachey #EarlyAviator #AvGeek #SFHistory  glass negative: Panama-Pacific International Exposition; 1913 Gift of Edwin I.
