        "body": "Eileen Reynolds Curtis (1915–77) was a San Francisco Bay Area studio potter who was known for hand-thrown ceramics with unique and distinctive glazes. She studied at Mills College in Oakland with F. Carlton Ball (1911–92), who encouraged Eileen and her husband Rossi Reynolds (1909–48) to evolve from amateur potters to professional ceramicists. By 1945, the Reynolds had established a pottery studio on Russian Hill in San Francisco and were producing ceramics full-time. Their work was inspired by the graceful forms of classical Chinese ceramics, along with the simple lines of traditional, stoneware jugs and bowls from the Ohio River Valley in Indiana where Eileen was raised.   Eileen and Rossi Reynolds worked with native materials such as California red and yellow clays. The Reynolds’ work was exhibited at museums including the San Francisco Museum of Art (now SFMOMA) and sold through local specialty retailers such as Gump’s.
