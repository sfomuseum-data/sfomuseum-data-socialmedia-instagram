This major milestone in air travel coincided with the launch of a modernized Pan Am brand by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes and his associate, Charles Forberg. Taking from the tradition of the globe and windswept typeface that Pan Am had used since the 1920s, they rendered the globe in gridlines, positioned a tightened logotype at the equator, and lightened the company color from navy to sky blue. This new servicemark was more distinct, particularly at a distance, and it became one of the most widely recognized in the world.",
