        "body": "In 2015, SFO Museum presented “I Love You, California: A Natural History.” California has the greatest diversity of natural areas, flora, and fauna species in North America. Around 6,000 species of the plants grow in California and within 160,000 square miles, huge variations in animal life thrive in the country’s third largest state. California also has an abundance of protected and preserved public use lands and national parks such as the Channel Islands, Point Reyes National Seashore, Joshua Tree, Yosemite, and Lassen Volcanic National Parks. Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park contains many of the oldest trees on Earth and is home to the largest living single organism by volume—the General Sherman, a giant sequoia believed to be about 2,500-years old. The tree is 275 feet tall and 102 feet in circumference.   Relive the exhibition in our online at: http://bit.ly/40Wf5pH",
