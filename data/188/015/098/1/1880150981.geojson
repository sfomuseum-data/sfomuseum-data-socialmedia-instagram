Smith in Arkansas, Federal Express, now shortened to FedEx, celebrates its 50th anniversary of launching operations this year! A strictly cargo-based airline, FedEx began operation with several custom-built Dassault Mystere-Falcon 20s. Generally used as a business jet, FedEx chose it for its compact form and high-speed capabilities, modifying the planes to include a cargo door and reinforcing the fuselage floors. In the following two decades, the airline expanded to include Boeing 727s and Douglas DC-10s in their fleet.",
