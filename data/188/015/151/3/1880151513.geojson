        "body": "Massachusetts native Ruth Law (1887–1970) was inspired to fly by her brother Rodman Law (1885–1919), a parachutist and stuntman. She was refused training from Orville Wright (1871–1948) because he believed women were not mechanically minded. She eventually persuaded Harry Atwood (1883–1967) and Arch Freeman (1890–1918) to instruct her in Saugus, Massachusetts. In 1912, Law became the fifth woman in the United States to earn a pilot's license. During her flying career she set numerous records, including one for women’s altitude, and another for distance by either a male or female aviator in a flight from Chicago to New York in 1916. After World War I, she formed the Ruth Law Flying Circus and toured the United States. She retired from flying in 1922.  “First Flights: Early Women Aviators and their Aircraft” is on display post-security in Terminal 3 and online at: https://bit.ly/3wzDwfL",
