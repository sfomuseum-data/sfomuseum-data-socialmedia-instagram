This ebonized and polychromed pedestal with its painted lotus flowers provides a striking example of the style; the pedestal and wallpaper serve as perfect and elaborate compliments to each other. The use of metallic ink on the paper lend a dramatic glow to the wall.  Special thank you to @bradburywallpaper for making this exhibition possible. “The Victorian Papered Wall” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/VictorianPaperedWall",
