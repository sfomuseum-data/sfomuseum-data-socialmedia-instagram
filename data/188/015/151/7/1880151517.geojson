The design derives from a simple, collarless shirt worn by men and women in the pre-colonial Philippines. The tunic evolved from a much longer version in the early nineteenth century to the “classic” barong tagalog by the mid-nineteenth century. The quality of the material and intricacy of the embroidery reflected the social status of its wearer.
