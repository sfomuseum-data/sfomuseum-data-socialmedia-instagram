For instance, the suited businessman is a symbol of mainstream respectability, and contrasts with the bold, vividly dressed women. The grandmother figure is a maternal icon of power inspired by the “take charge” matriarchs in her hometown during World War II. The workman’s glove holds the world in its palm - a statement about the value of work and creativity.  See “World Civilization” by Viola Frey on display, post-security, in the International Terminal by gate A5 and online at: https://bit.ly/3RNiP8T",
