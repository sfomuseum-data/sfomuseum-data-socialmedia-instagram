        "body": "David Huffman (b. 1963), who was born and raised in Berkeley, CA, combines the aesthetics of science fiction, urban vernacular, and the language of abstraction to investigate the politics of race through the iconography of the basketball. The artist uses the basketball as a metaphor for the black body and its changing meaning throughout history. In “Prisoners Repast,” Huffman includes basketballs, as well as, the texture of basketball hoop netting, Kente cloth, and glitter with his expressive brushstrokes to emphasize the complex and multi-layered aspects of contemporary African American identity.  See “Prisoners Repast” by David Huffman on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/3liZxfu",
