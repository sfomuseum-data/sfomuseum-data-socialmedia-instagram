Our program began in 1997, with interviews of flying boat captains,  stewards and stewardesses, and other early commercial aviation figures who were living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Since then, the collection has grown to include the experiences of people of color, LGBTQ individuals, women working in nontraditional roles.  If youâ€™ve worked in commercial aviation and have a story to tell, please contact us!  Read about the program and some of our favorite excerpts in our blog post: http://bit.ly/3wJ8jpT",
