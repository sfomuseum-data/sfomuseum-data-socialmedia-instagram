Although more classical in its design than the Spanish Revival style of the 1937 building in which it was placed, the heavy bronze schedule board fit in with the lobby’s furnishings. It cost $767.35 when purchased in 1937, and for years the board was large enough to post the arrival and departure times for all scheduled airlines serving San Francisco. We use it these days to announce our current exhibitions at the Aviation Museum and Library, as well as any upcoming events.   See the 1937 schedule board on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal, just outside of the Aviation Museum and Library.",
