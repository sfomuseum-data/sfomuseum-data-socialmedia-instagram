        "body": "Dorr Bothwell (1902–2000) was a Symbolist painter, printmaker, and art teacher who experimented with a variety of media and artistic ideas. Born Doris Hodgson Bothwell in San Francisco, she moved to San Diego as a young girl and took art lessons with her family’s neighbor, the painter and sculptor Anna Marie Valentien (1862–1947). In the early 1920s Bothwell returned to San Francisco and studied at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) with Rudolph Schaeffer (1886-1988). After her first exhibition entry was rejected in 1924, female colleagues suggested to Bothwell she not sign her full first name to avoid gender discrimination from male reviewers. Instead, Bothwell legally changed her first name to Dorr, a nickname from childhood that she preferred.
