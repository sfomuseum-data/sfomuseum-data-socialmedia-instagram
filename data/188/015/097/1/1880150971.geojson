        "body": "Annabelle Lopez Ochoa was selected as one of twelve choreographers to create a thirty-minute ballet for San Francisco Ballet’s 𝘜𝘯𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥: 𝘈 𝘍𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘢𝘭 𝘰𝘧 𝘕𝘦𝘸 𝘞𝘰𝘳𝘬𝘴 (2018). For her first San Francisco Ballet commission, 𝘎𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘢, Lopez Ochoa drew inspiration from painter Pablo Picasso (1881–1973), particularly 𝘎𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘢 (1937), which he painted in response to the devastating bombing of the Basque town Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.  In her choreography, Lopez Ochoa sought to answer the question “How do you put cubism into movement?” She created cubist effects by arranging dancers into poses, so that the brain appears to see four heads and only two legs. The four principal dancers appear on stage as four embodiments of a person, sometimes separate, sometimes in pairs, or as a foursome.   Lopez Ochoa’s ballet also encompasses flamenco dance and bullfighting. The four principal dancers wear bull horns; the bull symbolizes violence and power—aggressor and victim.  Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
