        "body": "Japan Air Lines (JAL) was formed and initiated domestic operations in 1951. The airline launched transpacific international service between Tokyo and San Francisco with Douglas DC-6B airliners in 1954.  JAL introduced the Boeing 747 widebody in 1970, and two years later, received international, flag-carrier status. During this decade, JAL offered its passengers premium meal services on ceramic dishware created by Noritake of Japan featuring either a single crane or a flock of cranes in blue. These motifs were inspired by the JAL logo called the “tsurumaru” or \"crane circle,\" created in 1958 by Jerry Huff of Botsford, Constantine and Gardner of San Francisco who was inspired by Japanese Kamon or family crests.   “More than a Meal: Airline Meal Service Sets, 1960s–80s” is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/AirlineMealSets",
