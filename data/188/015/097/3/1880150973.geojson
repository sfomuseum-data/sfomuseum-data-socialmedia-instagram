The mosaic considers what defining characteristics make a city distinctive and offers a window onto Minervini’s version of San Francisco. The City’s familiar skyline includes the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and Transamerica Pyramid. However, they appear alongside newer towers and constructions of an imagined future. Native and exotic plant life, along with vessels and other forms represent the many cultures and people that shape the Bay Area as a unique place.   See “Hyper-Natural Bay Area” by Robert Minervini located post-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/3eu49Xm",
