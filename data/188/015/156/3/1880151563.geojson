Trained at the Wright School in 1914 at the age of eighteen, she became the ninth woman in the United States to earn a pilot’s license. In 1915, Marjorie was the only woman flying in the U.S. Aviation Reserve Corps. She also trained cadets from the Royal Canadian Flying Corps for service in World War I and earned the nickname “The Flying Schoolmarm.” She was credited with training over one hundred pilots during the war.   “First Flights: Early Women Aviators and their Aircraft” is on display post-security in Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3wzDwfL",
