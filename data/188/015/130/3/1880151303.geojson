        "body": "Until World War II, Transcontinental and Western Air Inc (TWA) primarily operated domestic passenger and mail services in the United States. In early 1946, TWA inaugurated transatlantic services from New York to Paris and Frankfurt with Lockheed L-049 Constellations, extending service to Rome, Athens, Lisbon, and Madrid several months later. In 1950, the company changed its name to Trans World Airlines, retaining its well-known initials.  Over the next decade, the airline, controlled by the famous business magnate and aviator Howard Hughes, emerged as one of the preeminent carriers flying to Europe. With its close ties to Lockheed Aircraft, TWA offered passengers the latest, most-advanced aircraft of the era with its “world’s largest” Constellation fleet.   In 1955, TWA introduced the long-range Lockheed 1049G or “Super-G” Constellation, and in 1957, inaugurated the transpolar, great-circle route to Europe from Los Angeles and San Francisco with the Lockheed L-1649 Starliner. The airline introduced nonstop, six-and-one-half-hour service to Europe with Boeing 707-331 jetliners in late 1959.",
