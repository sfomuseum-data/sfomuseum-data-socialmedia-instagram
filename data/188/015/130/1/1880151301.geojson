        "body": "Created through a merger as Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air in 1930, TWA was renamed Trans World Airlines during the early postwar era as it expanded into international routes. In 1959, the airline introduced jet flights to Europe, and soon after, launched its “Royal Ambassador” international first-class service. It was promoted by TWA as “the finest passenger service ever offered to airline travelers.” The Rosenthal China Company of Germany was contracted to create fine bone china tableware with a distinctive ambassadorial red sash and medallion design surrounding the cursive initials “RA”. This china pattern was so popular that TWA made it available for sale to the public through inflight catalogs. This set included embossed entree, bread, and side plates, along with a bowl and a demitasse cup with saucer. TWA also included Swedish glassware with the Royal Ambassador medallion and salt and pepper shakers. The International Silver Company produced flatware with a distinctive flowing, curvilinear pattern and the carrier’s “TWA” service mark.   More than a Meal: Airline Meal Service Sets, 1960s–80s” is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/AirlineMealSets",
