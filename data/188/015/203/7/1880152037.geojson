        "body": "Rome-based fashion designer #Valentino Garavani (b. 1932) brought his passion for color to TWA in 1971 with a uniform collection that included men’s wear and pants for women. Made of polyester, it was the first uniform that could be washed and drip dried without wrinkles—considered a blessing for layovers on long trips. Some 340 hostesses were asked for design input. This fashion direction reflected a new profile in the flight attendant profession where marriage no longer ended a career, and the mandatory retirement age was raised to sixty. The Valentino ensemble includes this short-sleeved dress with belted waist, short jacket, and winter coat. All buttons are embossed with the designer’s “V.” The plum dress suit and the brown knee-high boots are complemented visually by a signature scarf in plum and dark cream colors.",
