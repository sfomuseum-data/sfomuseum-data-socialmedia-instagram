        "body": "Parisian by birth, Hollywood costumer #JeanLouis (1907–1997) designed for hundreds of leading ladies, including a famous strapless gown worn by Rita Hayworth in “Gilda.” A frequent nominee and Oscar-winner, Louis had a long engagement with #United Air Lines and created this uniform for the airline’s 4,500 stewardesses. Worn from 1968 to 1970, the all-season outfit came in Hawaiian Sunset and Maliblue with a Miami Sands stripe. Two optional dresses were also made in Miami Sands with a Hawaiian Sunset or Maliblue stripe, along with a tri-color “jet-a-long” version worn only in flight.  Jean Louis’ popular A-line, double knit wool skimmer is slightly fitted and came with a choice of hemline length from top-of-the-knee to three inches above. The kepi-style hat playfully combines a military touch with the mod 1960s-look of the dress. Made of white vinyl or Hawaiian Sunset wool, the hat could be worn with a headscarf passed through the over-flap. This uniform is an early example of the design concept where outfits in different colors began allowing a degree of individualism, while unmistakably remaining company wear. Louis and others would develop this trend as airlines sought more wardrobe options. \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight  United Air Lines stewardess uniform  1968  Jean Louis Fashionaire, a Division of Hart, Schaffner \u0026 Marx Hat by Mae Hanauer SFO Museum Dress: Gift of Allen and Karen Bowman Hat: Gift of United Airlines Historical Foundation Hat insignia: Gift of Georgia Panter Nielsen  Dress insignia: Gift of Diane Willems Vaughan L2016.0301.048, .050, .127, .129 2005.018.083, 2006.017.044, 2012.100.054, 2015.088.008",
