        "body": "George S. Gordon had an idea about how to take Braniff International Airways marketing campaign in an unprecedented direction. Gordon negotiated with the world-renowned artist Alexander Calder to paint an entire Douglas DC-8-62, transforming it into a flying work of art. This aircraft, named “Flying Colors of South America”, entered service in 1973, on routes between the U.S. and premier South American destinations. Gordon, confident that the aircraft would be so strongly associated with Braniff by reputation, did not place the Braniff International logotype anywhere on the plane's exterior. Calder then commemorated the United States Bicentennial in 1976 with another aircraft, this time a Boeing 727, named the “Flying Colors of the United States.”",
