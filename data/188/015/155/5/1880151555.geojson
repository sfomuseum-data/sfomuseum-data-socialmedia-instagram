        "body": "Harvey Milk opened Castro Camera in 1972 with his romantic partner Scott Smith (1948–95) shortly after moving to San Francisco. The shop soon became a de facto welcome center for new arrivals and an important gathering place for the local gay community. The shop also served as Milk’s headquarters for his political campaigns. The image of a rainbow over Castro Camera, taken by Milk, was used in the shop to demonstrate different surface qualities of photographic paper available to his customers.   Today, in the former location of Castro Camera, 575 Castro Street, a mural of Harvey Milk, stands in the window of the apartment he and Scott shared above the store front. Additionally, plaque has been installed on the sidewalk in front of the shop dedicated to Harvey Milk and his legacy. Have you ever visited the location of Castro Camera?  See “Harvey Milk: Messenger of Hope” on display, both pre- and post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: http://bit.ly/HarveyMilkExhibition",
