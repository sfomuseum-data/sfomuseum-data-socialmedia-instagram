        "body": "Zimbabwe gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1980 following decades of conflict between minority white rule and majority Black opposition movements. Much of Zimbabwe, a landlocked country that is slightly smaller than California, is located on a plateau in southeastern Africa. The primary languages spoken by its approximately fifteen million inhabitants include English, Shona, and Ndebele. The country boasts a tropical climate with a rainy and dry season. Some of its top exports include gems, precious metals, nickel, and sugar. Zimbabwe serves as a gateway to Victoria Falls, the world’s largest waterfall and one of seven natural world wonders. The country’s largest wildlife sanctuary, Hwange National Park, includes a myriad of species, including one of the largest elephant populations in Africa. Its greatest archeological ruins include the medieval city of Great Zimbabwe, built entirely from stone beginning in the eleventh century. Now a World Heritage site, extensive stone structures once sheltered thousands of inhabitants.   See \"Stone Sculpture of Zimbabwe\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/ZimbabweSculpture",
