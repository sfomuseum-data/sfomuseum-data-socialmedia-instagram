        "body": "In the 1920s, aviation visionaries imagined how the nations of the Pacific Rim could be linked by a new mode of transportation: the aircraft. Lucrative and profitable airmail contracts were awarded by world governments. Various attempts to cross the pacific in the 1920s, such as the U.S. Navy’s Naval Aircraft Factory PN-9 flying boats in 1925, and the Southern Cross in 1928, finally culminated in 1935, when Pan American Airways opened the first regularly scheduled air service, flying the Sikorsky S-42 and Martin M-130 flying boats.  Featuring rare surviving airmail flight covers that document how the air route across the Pacific Ocean was established during the 1920s and 30s, “Airmail Down Under” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library, located on the departures level of the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/3wz8Z1T",
