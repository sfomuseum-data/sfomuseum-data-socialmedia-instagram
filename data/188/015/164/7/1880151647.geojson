        "body": "Our newest exhibition, “California Modernist Women: Groundbreaking Creativity” is now on display in Harvey Milk Terminal 1.   During the first half of the twentieth century, many of the Golden State’s most innovative artists and designers were women who faced great adversity due to prevailing gender inequality. The most determined pushed forward, driven by enthusiasm, strength, and unprecedented creativity.   This exhibition features thirteen female artists who worked primarily in California and the San Francisco Bay Area. Some, such as Ray Eames and Ruth Asawa, are internationally acclaimed, while other outstanding artists, such as Zahara Schatz and the Bruton sisters, enjoyed success in their time, yet were overlooked in subsequent years.
