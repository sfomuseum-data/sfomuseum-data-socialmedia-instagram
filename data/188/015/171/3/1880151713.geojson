This work is about those things—bees, flags, snow, bugs, mercury, rain, and flights of fancy.” Much of Carnwath’s work is about her own thoughts, reactions, and memories.  See “Fly, Flight, Fugit” by Squeak Carnwath on display, post-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/3P920nn",
