Lacroix opened his fashion house in 1987 and is often credited with reviving Parisian couture. In 2005, he brought the first major change to Air France’s uniform in seventeen years with a wardrobe of over one hundred pieces to dress the airline’s 36,000 employees. With a discreet and timeless elegance, this robe-manteau style dress came in a navy blue and blue-gray wool blend. It has top-stitched ribbing at the closure and a Japanese-style tie belt.",
