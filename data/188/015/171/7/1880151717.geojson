        "body": "Founded in 1924 by George Rihl, Compañía Mexicana de Aviación was Mexico’s flagship airline. Acquired by Pan American Airways in 1929, Mexicana de Aviación grew into Mexico’s largest and most reliable commercial airline.   In 1959, it changed its name to Mexicana and introduced a new logo. Three British-produced de Havilland Comet 4Cs were purchased during this time and Comet service was inaugurated to Los Angeles on July 4, 1960. During the next decade, the airline retired the Comet 4C, which was too costly to operate, and expanded its fleet of the more economical Boeing 727, which was easier to service and better suited to Mexicana’s route system. By 1978, the airline had expanded its service to San Francisco, recorded a decade of annual profits, and attained a reputation for quality and reliable service.   In 1981, the airline introduced the wide-body Douglas DC-10-15 on its high-density routes. During the 1990s, Mexicana began taking over some of the financially troubled AeroMexico's routes to Canada and South America and introduced the European-built Airbus A320. In 2010, after nearly eighty-five years of operation, the company filed for bankruptcy in the United States and Mexico due to debts and labor disputes and ceased operations.",
