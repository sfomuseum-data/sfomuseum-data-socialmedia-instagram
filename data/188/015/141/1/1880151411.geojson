        "body": "Designed in the International Style, SFO’s 1954 Terminal was a seven-story building and employed an innovative, dual-level layout that separated departures from arrivals. Dedicated roadways streamlined traffic to the terminal, and passenger entryways on both levels were fitted with hands-free, automatic doors—an exciting new invention at the time. Panoramic views of the airfield and San Francisco Bay were provided from multiple spectators’ terraces and the International Room restaurant. Passenger operations commenced on September 1 and exceeded 2.5 million for the first year.   See “The 1954 San Francisco International Airport Terminal” on display in the SkyTerrace in Terminal 2 and online at: http://bit.ly/32ooxEQ   The SkyTerrace located pre-security in Terminal 2 and is open Friday to Monday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.",
