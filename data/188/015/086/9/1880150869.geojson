San Francisco's Gilbert Baker, one of the original creators of the Rainbow Flag, was implored by City Supervisor and human rights leader Harvey Milk and other local activists to create a new symbol for the movement. Baker embraced the idea of a flag as an appropriate symbol to proclaim power for his “tribe,” and a rainbow to represent his community’s diversity. He assigned symbolic meaning to each of the flag’s original eight colors—pink for sexuality, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for art, indigo for peace and harmony, and purple for spirit. The flag debuted on Gay Freedom Day, June 25, 1978.   Learn more about Harvey Milk’s legacy in our exhibition, “Harvey Milk: Messenger of Hope,” on display, pre-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/HarveyMilkExhibition",
