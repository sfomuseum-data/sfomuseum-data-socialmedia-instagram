        "body": "From an early age, Albert (Al) Mueller, Jr., loved travel, specifically airline travel. Al spent most of his working years as a travel agent and began collecting airline memorabilia at the age of eleven after flying from Los Angeles to San Francisco to see family members. His love of flying grew from there. He started his career with independent agencies in Southern California in the 1960s, then opened his own travel agency in the 1970s. Alâ€™s career focused on educating and advocating for his customers and helping them navigate the complicated process of traveling.
