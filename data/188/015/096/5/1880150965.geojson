        "body": "Flying on the Concorde at twice the speed of sound was an aviation experience like no other, even for flight crews who often found it nearly as exciting as the passengers. Initially, British Airways’ female flight attendants wore specially designed Concorde uniforms, but shortly after the Concorde’s introduction, cabin crews switched to the airline’s standard uniform. In 1993, Irish designer Paul Costelloe (b. 1945) created a new ensemble for British Airways' female flight attendants that highlighted the loosely tailored aesthetic prevalent during the era. He combined the airline’s corporate colors into \"Aztec\" pattern blouses and dresses complemented by navy-blue skirts, jackets, and straw Madeline hats. It was one of the longest-serving uniforms in the airline’s history and was issued until shortly after the Concorde’s retirement in 2003.
