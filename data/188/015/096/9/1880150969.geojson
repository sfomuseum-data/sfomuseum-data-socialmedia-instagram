        "body": "Margaret De Patta (1903–64) was one of the first modernist American jewelers. During the 1920s, she trained as an avant-garde painter at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) and the Art Students League in New York City. After an unsuccessful search for a modern wedding band, De Patta resolved to make her own ring—which ignited an interest in jewelry design that changed her trajectory as an artist. De Patta apprenticed as a jeweler for two months in 1929 and then set out on her own, studying books on jewelry-making and experimenting with unconventional metals and gemstones.
