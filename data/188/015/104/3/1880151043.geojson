        "body": "Freda Koblick (1920–2011) was a native of San Francisco who pioneered cast-acrylic plastic sculpture. The first woman to graduate from the Plastic Industries Technical Institute in Los Angeles, she envisioned plastic as a fine arts medium that could provide exciting possibilities beyond the material’s traditional, industrial applications. Koblick found that the control of curvature, plane, and texture was far more precise to accomplish in plastic than with other transparent media such as glass. According to the artist, she was fascinated by “the promise and the mystery of transparency” of plastic as art, specifically when the internal structure of a piece played a dynamic counterpart to reflections on the surface.
