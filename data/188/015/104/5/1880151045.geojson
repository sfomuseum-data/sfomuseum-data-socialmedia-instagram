The Brutons shared major commissions and collaborated closely, no matter who was charged with the project. Raised in Alameda, California, they attended The Art Students League of New York, where Margaret painted and Helen sculpted, while Esther transferred to the New York School of Fine and Applied Art to study commercial art.
