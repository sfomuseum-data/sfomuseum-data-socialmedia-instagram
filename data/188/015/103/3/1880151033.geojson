        "body": "While in a bookstore, choreographer Cathy Marston came across Charles Webb’s 1963 novel “The Graduate.” Glancing at the book jacket, she realized that the book was written in San Francisco. “I immediately thought—this is it,” explained Marston, “This is the piece that I need to make for San Francisco Ballet.”   Marston is drawn to complex female characters, including Mrs. Robinson, the infamous, older woman who seduces a younger man in “The Graduate.” In the ballet \"Mrs. Robinson\" Marston reimagined The Graduate from Mrs. Robinson’s perspective to rewrite Mrs. Robinson’s destiny. In addition to the central characters, Marston enlists a corps de ballet of women, who move with the crisp efficiency of ideal mid-century femininity—and express the crippling impact of maintaining it. As the piece unfolds, the domestic goddesses are swept into the feminist movement in waves.  Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
