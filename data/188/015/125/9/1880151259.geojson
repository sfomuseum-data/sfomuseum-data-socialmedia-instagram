        "body": "For the past thirty-four years, Lions Clubs around the globe have sponsored a unique art contest in schools and youth groups that provides students the opportunity to promote peace. Creating peace posters allows children to express their visions of peace, while inspiring amity through art and creativity. The students employ a variety of mediums, such as graphite, pen and ink, markers, and watercolors. One grand prize winner and twenty-three merit award winners are announced each year on Lions Day at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.  Thirteen-year-old grand prize winner Anja Rožen of Slovenia, who was sponsored by the Slovenj Gradec Lions Club, created a striking poster of arms representing the Earth knitting people of all colors together.  Special thank you to Silicon Valley Cyber Lions Club for making this exhibition possible. “We Are All Connected” posters from the Lions Clubs International Peace Poster Contest, is on display pre-security, on the departures level of Harvey Milk Terminal 1. https://bit.ly/3fC0eOM",
