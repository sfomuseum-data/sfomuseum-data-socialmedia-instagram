Working across a wide range of disciplines with a deep sense of social purpose for more than six decades, the artist developed a uniquely open-ended, inclusive, and forward-looking perspective on global culture.   In 2018, SFO Museum and the Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum (@noguchimuseum) presented an exhibition on the famed industrial designer and sculptor, “Isamu Noguchi: Inside and Out”. Featuring various stone and sheet metal sculptures and light fixtures, the exhibition celebrated works from the 1950s to the 1980s. Do you remember this exhibition?
