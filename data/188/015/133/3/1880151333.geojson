        "body": "San Francisco and Oakland (SFO) Helicopter Airlines was founded in 1961. Offering local helicopter flights between San Francisco and Oakland airports and their downtown areas, service began with two leased Sikorsky S-62s. By the end of 1962, the service grew to 100 flights a day. In 1963, the company received the first permanent certificate issued by the C.A.B to any helicopter carrier. In 1965, the C.A.B. allowed SFO Helicopter to start operating hovercraft. The new transbay route was operated by a Saunders-Roe SR.N5, which held 15 passengers and could travel at speeds up to 70 knots. SFO Helicopter Airlines was the first American company to operate these vehicles. However, this commercial hovercraft test only lasted about a year. Financial troubles began to plague the company leading to bankruptcy in 1970, yet the airline was able to still operate until 1976. SFO Helicopter Airlines resumed scheduled passenger service around 1983, but operations only lasted until 1985.",
