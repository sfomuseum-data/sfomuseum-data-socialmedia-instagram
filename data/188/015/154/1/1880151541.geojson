He also believed and instructed that more color should adorn ceilings as they did not serve as a background like the walls or floor. He enjoyed a prolific career, designing everything from wallpaper to furniture, metalwork, ceramics, and textiles. Like other Victorians of his era, Dresser absorbed historical styles, though he believed that a designer should “study the ornament of bygone eras till he understands it and feels its spirit, and then...strive to produce new forms and new combinations” reflecting the present era.   Special thank you to Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers for making this exhibition possible. “The Victorian Papered Wall” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/VictorianPaperedWall",
