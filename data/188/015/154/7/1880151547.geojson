        "body": "During the mid-1920s, San Francisco leaders envisioned their city as the western terminus of a new transcontinental air mail system. In the early years of aviation before airline travel was practical, the United States Post Office Department pioneered commercial flight with a nationwide network of air mail routes that stretched from New York to the West Coast. The Air Mail (or Kelly) Act of 1925 privatized service, and in March 1927 the city negotiated with Boeing Air Transport to fly mail from Chicago to San Francisco—provided an airfield was operational by July 1. City officials signed a three-year lease for 150 acres of cattle-grazing land from Ogden Mills, and less than two months later on May 7, a 5,770-foot-long, dirt-surfaced runway was dedicated at Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco.   See “Mills Field and the San Francisco Airport” on display in the SkyTerrace in Terminal 2 and online at: https://bit.ly/2XU7rAz   The SkyTerrace located pre-security in Terminal 2 and is open Friday to Monday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.",
