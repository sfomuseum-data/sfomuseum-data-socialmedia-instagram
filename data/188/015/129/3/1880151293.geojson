        "body": "Formed in 1931 from the merger and acquisition of several airlines, United Air Lines grew and prospered as one of the leading U.S. coast-to-coast carriers during the ensuing decades. In 1959, the airline launched Douglas DC-8 jet service on its transcontinental routes, and shortly thereafter, introduced the Silhouette “Debonair” pattern for its first-class inflight meal services. United contracted the Syracuse China Company of Syracuse, New York, to create ceramic plates, bowls, coffee cups, and saucers in a classic, beige, scalloped edge design. The pattern comprised a brown line around the rim and United’s shield and circle logo. The set also included a matching ceramic teapot. The service mark was repeated on the glassware, while the silver-plated flatware by the International Silver Company featured United’s shield logo with the carrier’s cursive-script logotype. Designed in a traditional, retrospective style, the pattern allowed United to create an inflight meal experience reminiscent of an upscale, family-oriented American restaurant. Prepared in its San Francisco kitchen, United’s hearty entrees included broiled ham steaks with pineapple and whipped potatoes. The set was in use until 1970.  More than a Meal: Airline Meal Service Sets, 1960s–80s” is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/AirlineMealSets",
