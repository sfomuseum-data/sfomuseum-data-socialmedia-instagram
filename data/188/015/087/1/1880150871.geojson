This whimsical post card from the late 1930s, featuring a Pan American Martin M-130 “Clipper” flying over the Golden Gate Bridge, would have made it easy to share your experience in our city without taking too much time from your trip. How would you have filled this postcard out?   “Dear Sweetheart, How’s tricks? I am flying high. I wish I had a home here. San Francisco is the place for me. Doing lots of sightseeing. I have seen the bridges. I will be gone longer. Yours ‘til the cows come home.” Name…….  postcard: Pan American Airways, Martin M-130, San Francisco, Calif.; late 1930s Gift of Jon E.
