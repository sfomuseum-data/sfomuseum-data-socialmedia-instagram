        "body": "Founded as Varney Speed Lines in 1934, Continental Airlines rapidly expanded its regional services between Los Angeles and Chicago and across the Southwest during the 1950s and 60s. When the airline became an international carrier in the late 1960s, it launched a new corporate identity created by the design firm Saul Bass \u0026 Associates. Their service mark featured an aerodynamic oval with jet contrails designed to communicate the carrier’s new global services. Over the next two decades, “Contrails Red” became the predominant color, while the symbol also appeared in gold, black, and white. In the 1980s, Continental offered its first- and business-class passengers premium meals on white china with the Contrails Red logo.   “More than a Meal: Airline Meal Service Sets, 1960s–80s” is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/AirlineMealSets",
