        "body": "Ozark Air Lines was founded in 1943 in Springfield, Missouri, and although service began in 1945, it was quickly halted as the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) had not issued them a license to operate. When another airline, Parks Air Lines, failed to commence operations, Ozark purchased the airline, received their certification, and began operating their routes in 1950. Flights from St. Louis to Chicago, Tulsa, and Memphis were on Douglas DC-3s acquired from Parks. Instead of repainting the DC-3s, Ozark took off the P and S from the aircraft and painted on OZ to the beginning.   By the end of the 1950s, the airline had rapidly expanded into 35 cities.  In 1966, Ozark entered the jet age and purchased several Douglas DC-9 aircraft, and added destinations to Denver, Indianapolis, Louisville, Washington, New York, Miami, Tampa, and Orlando. From 1978 to 1984, Ozark flew DC-9s almost exclusively as they phased out their older aircraft. In 1986, Ozark was purchased by Trans World Airlines (TWA).",
