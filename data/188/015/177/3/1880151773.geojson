        "body": "Air New Zealand was founded as TEAL (Tasman Empire Airways Limited) #onthisday in 1940. TEAL was created as a joint venture between BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation), Qantas Empire Airways, and the New Zealand government. Service was launched from Auckland, New Zealand, to Sydney, Australia, four days later with the Short S.30 flying boat Aotearoa (the Māori name for New Zealand). In 1953, TEAL became owned jointly by the New Zealand and Australian governments. In 1961, the New Zealand government bought out the Australian government’s share of TEAL, and, in 1965, the company changed its name to Air New Zealand. In 1973, the carrier began using the “Koru” logo representing the tip of the silver fern. An integral part of native New Zealand Māori art and culture symbolizing new growth, strength and peace, the name and logo were also used on a wide range of products associated with the airline. Have you ever been to New Zealand?",
