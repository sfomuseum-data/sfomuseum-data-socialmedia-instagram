        "body": "Operating from 1946 to 1968, China's Civil Air Transport’s (CAT) initial mission was to carry relief supplies on westbound flights from coastal ports to the war-devastated interior, and commercial cargo and passengers on return fights to the coast.    In 1946, CAT hired eighty-seven men and women. Setting up headquarters at Shanghai’s Hungjao airfield, five surplus Douglas C-47s and fourteen Curtiss C-46s were purchased, with three more for spare parts.    After China’s civil war (1945-1949), CAT relocated to the island of Taiwan in 1950, and evolved from a relief cargo airline to a government contractor and commercial carrier. In 1953, the airline formally became the flag carrier of the Republic of China.   With the addition of a Convair 880, on July 11, 1961, CAT became Asia’s first regional airline to offer its passengers jet service. Facing route reduction and increased competition, CAT sold its Convair 880 and replaced, it with a Boeing 727. Tragically, CAT’s new jet was lost near Taipei on February 16, 1968. By May, CAT’s domestic services shut down.",
