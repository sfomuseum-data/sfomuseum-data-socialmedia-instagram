        "body": "After Japan opened to international trade, following a prolonged period of isolation from the West, French author Philippe Burty coined the term Japonisme in 1872 to describe the new fervor for all things Japanese. The increased visibility of Japanese art and design overseas profoundly affected European and North American audiences. Japonisme permeated fine and decorative arts, interior design, and graphic arts. Rather than directly copying, Western artists drew freely from Japanese ornament, reinterpreting objects ranging from sterling silver flatware and holloware to colorful ceramic plates and vessels. This exhibition features American and European decorative arts from the 1870s-90s, when Japonisme reached its peak in popularity.  See “Japonisme: A Passion for Japan” on display, post-security, in Terminal 2 and online at: https://bit.ly/JaponismeSFO",
