In 2003, the carrier outfitted their ground staff and flight crews in new uniforms conceived by the celebrated Australian designer Peter Morrissey (b. 1961). The flight attendant dress featured a unique Australian Aboriginal pattern with boomerangs and circular motifs called “Wirriyarra,” which means \"\"My Spirit Home\"\" in the Yanyuwa Aboriginal language. The pattern was repeated on the male flight attendant ties and pocket inserts.    See “Flying the Southern Cross Route: Seventy-Five years of Australian Commercial Air Service to North America” on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and online at: https://bit.ly/3BnvkPy",
