California played a central role in the formation of a modern American aesthetic during the mid-twentieth century. Many of the Golden State’s most innovative artists and designers were women who faced great adversity due to prevailing gender inequality. The most determined pushed forward, driven by enthusiasm, strength, and creativity. “California Modernist Women: Groundbreaking Creativity” introduces these and other artists who worked in California and the San Francisco Bay Area.
