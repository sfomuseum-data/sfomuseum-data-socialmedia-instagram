Recreating the journey of the first United 747 flight from SFO to Honolulu in 1970, the airline threw a farewell party in Terminal 3 of SFO. Dubbed the “Friend Ship” when first introduced by United, the wide-body 747 provided an entirely new level of passenger comfort and service. In early versions, the second deck behind the cockpit was outfitted as a “red carpet lounge” that passengers accessed via a spiral staircase. United also boasted that they had moved “the kitchen out of the living room” by moving the galley from the cabin down to the spacious cargo hold.",
