        "body": "Louis Overstreet (1921–80) began singing in gospel quartets at an early age. In 1938, he explained that the Lord spoke to him in a vision, “told me to get a Bible, and a guitar and go out onto the highways and preach the gospel…went out and bought a guitar—paid $200 for a Gibson. I did like the Lord said. About forty-five days after I bought it he gifted me with music.” Overstreet performed a unique blend of musical street evangelism using his powerful singing voice, an amplified guitar, and his gospel quartet made up of his four sons. Overstreet became pastor of a small church in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1962. It was here that Chris Strachwitz, founder of Arhoolie Records, met and recorded Overstreet, his sons, and his congregation for this LP. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie . . .",
