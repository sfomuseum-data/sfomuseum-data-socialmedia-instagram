        "body": "Matilde Moisant was born in Indiana and was the sister of aviators John (1868–1910) and Alfred (1862–1929) Moisant. Instructed along with her friend Harriet Quimby (1875–1912) by aviator André Houpert (1886–1963) at her brother’s Moisant Aviation School in New York, Moisant earned her pilot’s license in 1911. She was just the second licensed woman aviator in the United States at the time. That same year, she broke the women’s altitude record at Garden City, New York. She toured briefly with the Moisant exhibition team before experiencing an accident in 1912. She retired from flying shortly after.  “First Flights: Early Women Aviators and their Aircraft” is on display post-security in Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3wzDwfL",
