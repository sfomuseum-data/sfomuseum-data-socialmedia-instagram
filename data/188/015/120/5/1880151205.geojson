        "body": "Robert Hudson (b. 1938), along with his childhood friend William T. Wiley (1937-2021), was a seminal figure in Bay Area Funk, a regional movement in the late 1950's and 1960's. Although perhaps best known for his sculptural assemblages, Hudson has also produced a large body of paintings and drawings during his distinguished career. With characteristic wit and irony, Hudson's canvases play with creating visual contradictions between three-dimensional illusion and flat, two-dimensional space. Here, a flat, geometrical background is combined with representational imagery to create visual contradiction between the illusionistic spaces and the flat background surface.   See “Horse of Another Color” by Robert Hudson on display, post-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/3jhAdWr",
