Keen eyes will spot the three proposed runway locations and lengths, as well as the administrative building and hangar.   The City’s Engineer, Michael O’Shaughnessy, was a busy man at the time: in addition to creating an airport, he had overseen the conception and construction of the Hetch Hetchy dam and multiple transportation and sewage tunnels throughout San Francisco.",
