First on the list is the one of the more unusual objects in our collection: a disposable obstetrical kit!  Although a rare occurrence, babies are delivered onboard planes—an article published by the Journal of Travel Medicine found that 74 babies were born on 73 commercial flights between 1929 and 2018. (That number has since grown, as last year saw in-air deliveries on both Frontier and American Airlines.) This disposable obstetrical kit includes a disposable scalpel, a bulb aspirator, and a receiving blanket among other things one would need to deliver a baby aboard an aircraft.",
