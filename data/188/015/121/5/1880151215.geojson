The bridge spans almost two miles of water between Marin and San Francisco and held the title of the longest suspension bridge, main span, for almost 30 years. This gigantic undertaking was completed in 1937. Did you know that the Golden Gate Bridge is not named for its color but for the body of water it crosses, the Golden Gate strait? The bridge is painted in \"International Orange\" color to provide enhanced visibility for passing ships. Have you visited this popular tourist destination?",
