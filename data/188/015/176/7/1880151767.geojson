        "body": "Eastern Air Lines’ origins go back to the 1920s with routes throughout the Atlantic states. Headquartered in New York, Eastern’s early success occurred under the direction of World War I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker, who purchased the airline from General Motors in 1938. The company had a near monopoly on inter-East Coast services from the 1930s to the 1950s. The carrier promoted its image with an eagle symbol and a slogan describing its airplanes as “The Great Silver Fleet.” With the advent of the jet age, a new logo was developed as an abstract representation of the eagle. The new symbol’s clean lines and sense of speed was matched with the company name in a modern typeface to create a distinct trademark. Due to labor disputes, rising fuel costs, excessive debt, and other financial problems, Eastern ceased operations in 1991.",
