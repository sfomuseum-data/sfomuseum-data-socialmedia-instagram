        "body": "Today is National Nurse’s Day. Did you know during the 1930s and 40s, stewardess across various airlines required to be trained nurses? Ellen Church, a registered nurse, began her first shift as the first female cabin crewmember at Boeing Air Transport (BAT) on May 15, 1930. Hired by Boeing in their San Francisco office in 1930, she pioneered the “stewardess” profession and recruited seven more women. Their jobs also included weighing passengers and luggage, loading and unloading bags, helping to fuel airplanes, and occasionally pushing the airplane into hangars.  Nurses have always been essential, and it’s never been more obvious than over the last two years. To all nurses everywhere: THANK YOU for your perseverance and unwavering care throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. You are our heroes.",
