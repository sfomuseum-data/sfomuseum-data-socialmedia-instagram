        "body": "Founded by George T. Baker in 1934, National Airlines started as an air mail carrier, as did many airlines at that time. Initially based in St. Petersburg, it began by transporting mail between destinations within Florida. By the end of the decade, the growing company opened a service to New Orleans, called the “Buccaneer Route.”  In 1944, National was awarded a New York-Miami route; flights began the following year. Flight times on the route were shortened in 1946 when the Douglas DC-4 was introduced, allowing non-stop flights and increasing both revenue and prestige.  Expansion continued through the 1950s with the introduction of a jet airliner at the end of the decade. National had the distinction of becoming the first domestic operator of jets in the United States after leasing a Boeing 707-120 jet from Pan American—which was only flying internationally. On December 10, 1958, the airline inaugurated jet service between New York and Miami. In 1961, National's route service was extended from Houston to California cities including Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco.   In 1980, Pan American World Airways purchased National Airlines to expand into the U.S. domestic market. Pan American continued to fly National’s domestic routes until it ceased operations in 1991.",
