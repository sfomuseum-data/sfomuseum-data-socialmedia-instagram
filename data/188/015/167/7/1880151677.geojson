The carving movement has grown to where we are now into the fifth generation of carvers…I am willing to teach others to carve. You [must] be very disciplined and love hard work and art. I never thought I would be an artist, but it is in our family. I believe I was born poor, but rich in mind, and I love my chosen path.”  – Wonder Mazhindu  Born in Harare, Shona sculptor Wonder Mazhindu (b. 1982) learned to carve from his brother Picket Mazhindu Bumhira (b. 1968). After completing his education in 1999, he focused on stone carving and developed a distinctive style. Mazhindu enjoys working with harder types of stone, such as soapstone. His work has been exhibited in Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China, South Korea, and Australia.
