        "body": "Before becoming an aviator, the Belgian-born Hélène Dutrieu was a world-champion cyclist, an automobile racer, a stunt performer, and a comedic actor. She first flew in early 1910 and earned her pilot’s license from the Aéro-Club de Belgique (Aero Club of Belgium) the same year, becoming only the fourth woman aviator to be licensed. Known as the “Girl Hawk,” Dutrieu was the first winner of the Coupe Femina (Femina Cup) in 1910 and won it again the following year. In 1911, she won the Coppa del Re (King's Cup) race in Florence, Italy, besting fourteen other male aviators.  “First Flights: Early Women Aviators and their Aircraft” is on display post-security in Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3wzDwfL",
