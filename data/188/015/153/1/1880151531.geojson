        "body": "In 1912, Julia Clark became the third woman in the United States to earn a pilot’s license. Michigan-born Clark (1880–1912) became interested in aviation in 1911, when she attended the Chicago International Aviation Meet. After first overcoming the reluctance of Glenn Curtiss to accept her as a student, she trained at the Curtiss School of Aviation in North Island, San Diego. After earning her pilot's license, she joined the Curtiss exhibition team and was billed as \"The Daring Bird-Girl.\"   “First Flights: Early Women Aviators and their Aircraft” is on display post-security in Terminal 3 and online at: https://bit.ly/3wzDwfL",
