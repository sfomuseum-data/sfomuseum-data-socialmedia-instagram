Pan American pioneered commercial airline service to Latin America and the Caribbean in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when air travel was first developing into a viable form of transportation. Founded in 1927 by Juan Trippe (1899–1981), the airline grew rapidly during its fledgling years, purchasing or partnering with numerous competing airlines along the way. In less than three years, Pan American’s routes increased from an inaugural 261-mile Miami-Havana line to over 19,000 miles throughout two continents. By 1930, the Pan American Airways System linked twenty-nine Latin American and Caribbean countries and territories with regularly scheduled airmail, passenger, and cargo flights.",
