        "body": "Innovative combinations of natural materials were at the core of the success of Sausalito, California’s @heathceramics, started by Edith Heath (1911–2005) and her husband Brian Heath (1913–2001). Unimpressed with lightly colored, commercially available clays, Edith Heath formulated clay bodies from rich deposits left by a prehistoric inland sea near Lincoln, California, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains foothills. Glazes that contained metallic oxides were perfected to chemically react at low temperatures. Some of her distinctive finishes created speckled effects when fired in the kiln, such as the graduated, two-toned “Sea and Sand.” Heath introduced Coupe in 1948, which is still in production and was their first original dinnerware line. Coupe pioneered manufacturing at Heath Ceramics, with plates and shallow bowls formed on jiggering wheels developed by Brian, while Edith and her artisans used traditional slip casting for more complex shapes.  \"See “California Modernist Women: Groundbreaking Creativity” on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/CaliforniaModernistWomen",
