        "body": "On January 21, 1905, legendary fashion designer Christian Dior was born in Granville, France. The House of Dior, having brought haute couture to airline uniform design, was engaged by Air France to launch its new collection in 1962 as the jet age transformed world travel. Created by chief designer Marc Bohan (b. 1926), it followed his 1961 “Slim Look.” In crisp Marceau blue natté canvas, this winter suit’s short jacket, tight at the waist yet with beltless freedom, has natural shoulders creating a clean line with the paneled skirt. The stitched flat bow of the poly-cotton Ceylon blouse graces the Peter Pan collar, and a navy velour pillbox hat with crest replaces the beret. Hailed by fashion critics, this pivotal uniform elegantly married mobility with sophistication.",
