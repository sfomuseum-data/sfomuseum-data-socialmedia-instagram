        "body": "Yorgo Alexopoulos creates paintings, time-based media artworks, and installations. He often synchronizes multiple monitors or projections in a dynamic ensemble to create an ever-changing, immersive spectacle. Using landscape symbolism as a point of departure, he combines geometric shapes with a multiplicity of moving images, whether filmed, photographed, painted, or drawn, that unite representation and abstraction into a common aesthetic. In “Split,” Alexopoulos manipulates formal elements such as color and shape, morphing them into and out of real and imagined landscapes. In one scene, two moons slowly travel across a large rising sun, and in another, a camera pans across a golden solarized wetland. Ultimately, his pieces inspire us to think introspectively about things that are larger than ourselves.  See “Split” by Yorgo Alexopolus on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. https://bit.ly/3Hc0u1L",
