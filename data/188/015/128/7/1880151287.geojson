        "body": "In the mid-1980s, Qantas introduced a new corporate look with a fresh livery for their aircraft, along with a new line of cabin and ground crew uniforms. Created by French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent (1936-2008), the flight attendant uniforms featured a dress or blouse with a colorful blue, red, yellow, and brown print on white incorporating a new kangaroo logo. The uniform was complemented by a smart royal blue jacket with a burnt-orange collar and sleeve cuffs. The airline’s logo was affixed on the lapel. A matching scarf with the kangaroo pattern on black completed the ensemble. The carrier also introduced the new widebody Boeing 767 and upgraded to the Boeing 747-300 and 747SP widebody jetliners in the 1980s. By 1987, the airline maintained twenty-one 747s and six 767s in its fleet and placed a large order for the next generation 747-400, introduced in 1989.
