        "body": "Transcontinental and Western Air Inc (TWA) was founded in July 1930 through a merger of several airlines and was one of the first airlines to offer transcontinental service. Its first all-air coast-to-coast service took place on October 25, 1930, in a Ford Tri-motor. The trip took 36 hours and included an overnight stay in Kansas City.   During the late 1930s, TWA, under the leadership of its visionary controlling shareholder Howard Hughes, requested that the Lockheed Aircraft Company of Burbank, California, produce a fast, large capacity, pressurized airliner. Lockheed was already developing a pressurized airliner designated the L-44 Excalibur when Hughes approached the company to have it made to TWA’s specifications. Designed in complete secrecy under the leadership of Lockheed’s chief research engineer Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson, with ample direction from Hughes, the renamed 049 Constellation evolved into an extremely fast, revolutionary large capacity airliner with a unique dolphin-shaped fuselage and distinctive tripletail.",
