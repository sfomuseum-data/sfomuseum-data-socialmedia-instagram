        "body": "Our newest exhibition “From Pineapple to Piña: A Philippine Textile Treasure” is now on display in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. Unique to the Philippines, piña is an extraordinary textile made by weaving the fibers of the leaves of the pineapple plant. This light, airy fabric was perfectly suitable to the tropical climate. The textile enjoyed a golden age during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly on the island of Panay, where it was made into shirts, women’s blouses, shoulder scarfs, handkerchiefs, and table linens. This exhibition features a selection of nineteenth-century examples of piña from Lacis Museum of Lace and Textiles (@lacismuseum) that illustrates the fine workmanship of early artisans. It also includes modern piña garments made by Filipino fashion designer Anthony Cruz Legarda (@anthonycruzlegarda).
