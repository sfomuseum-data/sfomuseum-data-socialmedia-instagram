        "body": "Continental Airlines began as Varney Speed Lines in 1934. It originally used symbols and slogans to promote its claim to be the “Fastest Airline In The World.” Renamed in 1937 as Continental Airlines, the carrier introduced a red, white, and blue eagle symbol with its block letter logotype in 1944. When Continental became an international carrier in 1968, it launched a new corporate identity created by Saul Bass \u0026 Associates. An oval, defined in spreading jet contrails, and an updated typeface communicated its new global status and market position. “Contrails Red” became the predominant color, while gold, orange, and black were retained as secondary colors. In 2011, Continental merged with United Airlines.",
