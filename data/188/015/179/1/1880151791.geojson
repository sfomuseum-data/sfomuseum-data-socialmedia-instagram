Wooden buckets chilled champagne and promoted Pan Americanâ€™s service, while stewards served the beverage in fine glassware. This wine glass was specially designed not to spill during turbulence and first used in 1936 during the first commercial passenger flight across the Pacific Ocean on the Martin M-130 Hawaii Clipper.
