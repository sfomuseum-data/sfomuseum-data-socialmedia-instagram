        "body": "Get a glimpse into San Francisco’s Outer Mission neighborhood through Kari Orvik’s ongoing photography series, “Geneva”, centered on the corner of Mission Street and Geneva Avenue. A resident of the Mission for over twenty years, Orvik has developed relationships with other residents and small business owners in the neighborhood, photographing them both on the street corner and in her studio.   Over time, the photographs have become a document of the neighborhood, parts of which remain and parts of which are no longer there. Her work is often site-specific and engages ideas of presence and absence; exploring what we hold onto, what we let go, and where we place value.  See “Geneva” by Kari Orvik on display in the Ruth Kadish Gallery, located in the post-security connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3MjrKM8",
