Yuen worked at SFO for 24 years from 1968 to 1992 as the director of Planning and Construction and after he retired, the chairman of the Master Plan Advisory Board. Born in China in 1935, he came to San Francisco in 1946. After graduating from George Washington High School in San Francisco, he earned a bachelor’s degree in architecture from the UC Berkeley in 1959. He began his tenure at the City and County of San Francisco in 1963 before transferring to the Airport in 1968 as the head of the Architectural Department. In 1979, he became the director of Planning and Construction.   During his time at the Airport, Yuen helped complete the $240 million Terminal Modernization and Reconstruction Program on schedule, under budget and exceeding the standards of quality set forth by the Airport Commission. After retiring, Yuen became the chairman of the Master Plan Advisory Board, which helped to develop and implement the Airport's signature circular shape, including the airport's $933 million International Terminal which opened in 2000. In celebration of his achievements, the Airport named the Architecture and Engineering building in his honor.",
