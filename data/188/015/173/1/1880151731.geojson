        "body": "Introduced in 1959, the Douglas DC-8 was United Air Lines’ first jet airliner to be launched into service and the second American jetliner to be launched into service after Boeing’s 707. Branded the “Jet Mainliner” by United, it was a major advancement in airliner design and officially launched the airline into the jet age. To help promote the new airliner to the traveling public, United had Pacific Miniatures of Alhambra, California, create several large cutaway models to highlight the DC-8’s new features and amenities, particularly its spacious and luxurious cabin interior. Created to be an easily viewable, three-dimensional presentation of the Jet Mainliner in miniature, the cutaway model contains a highly detailed cockpit and cabin interior with minute features that accurately replicate the actual United DC-8 as launched in 1959.  See “Jet Mainliner in Miniature: The United Air Lines Douglas DC-8 Cutaway Model” on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and online at: https://bit.ly/3AEyqiS",
