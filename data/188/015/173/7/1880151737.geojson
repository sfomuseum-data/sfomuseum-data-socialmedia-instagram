        "body": "Professional sculptor Tererai Murambatsvina (b. 1973) comes from the Masvingo region of Zimbabwe. While attending primary and secondary school, he felt drawn to art and craft. After completing his schooling, Murambatsvina spent six months as a metal worker before joining the stone carver Brighton Mtongwizo (b. 1975) in 1992 where he worked as a stone washer. In 1994, he began carving under the instruction of Kennedy Msekiwa (b. 1962). In addition to stone carving, Murambatsvina is also an experienced wood carver.
