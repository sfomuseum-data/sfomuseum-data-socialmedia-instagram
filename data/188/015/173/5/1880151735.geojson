The Chinatown, North Beach, The Mission, The Castro, Haight-Ashbury, and Fisherman’s Wharf neighborhoods were chosen because of their strong cultural identities and tourism economies.  In his artwork, Rodriguez explores the identity of place, encouraging the viewer to think about the signifiers of place and how they influence our perception and experience of San Francisco neighborhoods.  See “Strangerhood” by Lordy Rodriguez on display, pre-security, on the arrivals level of Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/2Izj7By",
