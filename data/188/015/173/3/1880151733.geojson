Rome-based fashion designer Valentino brought his passion for color to TWA in 1971 with a uniform collection that included menâ€™s wear and pants for women. With a business-like look, this plum polyester knit dress suit has signature buttons and scarf. It marks a transition in airline fashion as age limits were removed and the profession became a longer-term career.",
