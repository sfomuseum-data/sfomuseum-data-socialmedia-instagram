        "body": "Harvey Milk (1930–78) made history in 1977 when he became the first openly gay individual elected to public office in the state of California. In the spring of 1978, San Francisco Mayor George Moscone signed a landmark gay rights ordinance authored by Supervisor Milk that banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment and housing anywhere in the city of San Francisco. Concurrently in 1978, Supervisor Harvey Milk was one of the most vocal critics against Proposition 6, a bill on California’s November ballot that would prohibit openly gay men and women from working in California’s public schools. The measure also allowed for those teachers who openly supported gays and lesbians to be fired.  Learn more about Harvey Milk's life and legacy in our exhibition, \"Messenger of Hope,\" which is on view pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. Not traveling? The exhibition catalog is available to read online! http://bit.ly/HarveyMilkExhibition",
