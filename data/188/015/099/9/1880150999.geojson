This DC-10 was painted with special livery which read “California here we come.” The route from Singapore to San Francisco, operated three times a week on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays with stops at Hong Kong and Honolulu eastbound and Honolulu, Guam and Hong Kong westbound. The total flying time between Singapore and San Francisco took 21 hours 30 minutes, and 24 hours 10 minutes in the opposite direction. Today, the non-stop flight takes 15 hours 25 minutes eastbound and 16 hours 40 minutes westbound on an Airbus A350-900. Have you ever flown on Singapore Airlines?",
