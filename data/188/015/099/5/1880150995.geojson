This exhibition chronicles airline passenger seating from its modest wicker origins in the 1920s, through the era of the propliner when comfort emerged as an important selling point in the 1950s, to the jet age in the 1960s when passenger seating studies led to the sophisticated, high-tech, multi-functional sitting machines of today.   See “Remain Seated: Airliner Passenger Chairs,” on display, pre-security in the Aviation Museum and Library, located on the departures level of the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/AirlinerChairs",
