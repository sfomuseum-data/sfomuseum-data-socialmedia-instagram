The costumes, though cut and tailored in a Western style, possess an African influence in their colors and patterns. For the women’s dresses, Woodall chose a silk satin material that she hand-painted, then turned the satin inward so the dancers would feel the movement of the fabric on their legs.   Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible. See “San Francisco Ballet at 90” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/SFBalletAt90",
