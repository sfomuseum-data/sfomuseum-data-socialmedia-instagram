        "body": "Interior design advice from the 19th century that holds up today: influential architect and furniture designer Charles Locke Eastlake encouraged a threefold division of walls in 1867, explaining to his readers that: “Paperhangings should in no case be allowed to cover the whole space of a wall from skirting to ceiling….The most dreary method of decorating the wall of a sitting-room is to cover it all over with an unrelieved pattern of monotonous design.”   Fashionable Aesthetic Movement interiors displayed a dado, which covered the lower part of the wall and provided an alternative to wood paneling. A complementary fill pattern above the dado set off framed prints hung from picture rails; and a frieze, or decorative border, adorned the top of walls.   Special thank you to Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers for making this exhibition possible. “The Victorian Papered Wall” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/VictorianPaperedWall",
