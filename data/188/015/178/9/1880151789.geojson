        "body": "Richard Diebenkorn was a California-based painter and printmaker who spent much of his renowned career in the Bay Area. He is most known for his Ocean Park series (1967–1988) that brought him international acclaim. Inspired by the geometric division of landscapes as seen by the artist from a helicopter, the works investigate the various ways of slicing a rectangle with horizontal and vertical lines. Diebenkorn called these prints the “bones” of the Ocean Park works.  See “#2, 3, 5, 7, from Nine Drypoints and Etchings” on display on Level 4 in the Grand Hyatt. https://bit.ly/3oRJnGx",
