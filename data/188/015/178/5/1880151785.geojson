        "body": "During the 1970s, pioneering American studio glass artist Marvin Lipofsky refined his formula for creating collaborative glass sculpture. The first stage was fast-paced and involved a number of glassmakers working in concert with one another over a handful of days. Multiple layers of clear and colored glass were heated in a furnace and rolled onto the end of a blowpipe. Once the hot glass was blown into a suitable bubble, it was placed into a mold to form its initial shape. Upon return to his Berkeley studio, Lipofsky shifted to a more reflective and contemplative approach. He spent countless hours with a diamond saw, pneumatic grinder, belt sander, and sandblasting cabinet, sculpting his blown glass forms into lively and organic expressions of studio craft.   \"Marvin Lipofsky: International Studio Glass\" is on view pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/MarvinLipofsky",
