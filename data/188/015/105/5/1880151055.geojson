In addition to the San Francisco Airport Commission Aviation Library and Louis A. Turpen Aviation Museum, SFO Museum has upwards of two dozen galleries located throughout the terminals. Additionally, the San Francisco Arts Commission displays over 100 works of art from their permanent collection in every terminal.  Last month the museum released an experimental web-based wayfinding service for navigating around the airport to locate our museum’s spaces. Our innovative IT expert, Aaron has written a blog post about this new tool and is asking for feedback! Check it out here: http://bit.ly/3SQryYM",
