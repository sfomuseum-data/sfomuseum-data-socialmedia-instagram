In 2018, we presented “Caticons: The Cat in Art,” which explored the history and allure of the cat through art, literature, and decorative arts from around the world. Cats were venerated by the ancient Egyptians and celebrated as symbols of good luck throughout Asia. In Europe, cats became associated with magic, witchcraft, and evil spirits and were persecuted for centuries before they gained cultural acceptance.  If you missed “Caticons: The Cat in Art” in 2018, you're in luck! Check it out online at: https://bit.ly/3AZTsuC",
