        "body": "In 1910, Blanche Scott (1884–1970) proved her automotive and mechanical skills by becoming the first woman to drive west across the continent from New York to San Francisco. (Side note: cross-country driving was far different then, as the journey took over two months!). This feat brought her to the attention of Glenn H. Curtiss (1878–1930), who agreed to provide her with flying lessons. Curtiss fitted a limiter on her plane’s throttle to prevent flight during her training. Nonetheless, Scott became one of the first American women to fly solo in early September 1910, when either a gust of wind or movement of the limiter resulted in her ascent for a brief flight at an altitude of forty feet before she executed a gentle landing. Often billed as “the Flying Tomboy,” Scott became a professional aviator later the same year and was the first woman in America to perform at air meets. A highly skilled aviator and stunt pilot, Scott toured as a star performer with several exhibition teams. She also flew for Glenn L. Martin (1886–1955) as a test pilot.  “First Flights: Early Women Aviators and their Aircraft” is on display post-security in Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3wzDwfL",
