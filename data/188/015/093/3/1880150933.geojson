        "body": "For his series, “Downwaste,” Jonathan Marquis visits glaciers in Montana’s Glacier National Park. He uses materials found at their melting edge to produce cyanotypes that visualize glacial melt and respond to glaciers as active agents of ice, rock, and snow. Downwasting is a glaciological term referring to the thinning of a glacier due to the melting of ice. The term’s use in this series references the production site of the image while emphasizing the loss of these places due to anthropogenic climate change.  “Downwaste” invites the viewer to consider glaciers as meaningful actors, whose existence shapes the landscapes that humans and ice coinhabit and depend upon.  See ”Downwaste,” by Jonathan Marquis, on display pre-security in Terminal 3 and online at: https://bit.ly/3HNGF0H",
