        "body": "Colombian-Belgian Annabelle Lopez Ochoa (b. 1973) trained at the Royal Ballet School of Antwerp, Belgium. She danced for twelve years before becoming a choreographer in 2003. Her varied repertoire includes short conceptual pieces, full-length narratives, and dance films. Lopez Ochoa has created works for over seventy dance companies worldwide, including 𝘍𝘳𝘪𝘥𝘢 for the Dutch National Ballet (2020), which explores the life of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. She is currently working on her first evening-length work for Ballet Hispánico in New York, 𝘋𝘰𝘯̃𝘢 𝘗𝘦𝘳𝘰́𝘯, which portrays the life of Argentinean former First Lady Eva Perón. In 2019, she received the prestigious Jacob’s Pillow Dance Award; she currently lives in Amsterdam.  In the choreography for her ballet, 𝘎𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘢, Lopez Ochoa sought to answer the question “How do you put cubism into movement?” She created cubist effects by arranging dancers into poses, so that the brain appears to see four heads and only two legs.  Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
