        "body": "For this suite of prints, Shaun O’Dell uses simplified icons of American history—liberty bells and silhouettes of the founding fathers—to depict the complexity of the past. In “Beyond When the Golden Portal Can Come,” O’Dell maps American genealogy, beginning with the pilgrims’ desire for liberty and the Mayflower’s voyage across the Atlantic, which led to contact with Native Americans. The artist goes on to complicate the American family tree in “Ghost Extraction Dialogue for the Followers of Blood,” highlighting that history is full of overlapping stories of individuals, who slip into obscurity.  “Beyond When the Golden Portal Can Come” and “Ghost Extraction Dialogue for the Followers of Blood” by Shaun O’Dell are on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. https://bit.ly/31YWbB7",
