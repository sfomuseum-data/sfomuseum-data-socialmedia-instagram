        "body": "Happy Birthday to Mark Adams, who was born #onthisday in 1925 in Fort Plain, New York. Early in his career. Adams established himself as a tapestry and stained-glass designer. These pieces, “Pond in Golden Gate Park,” “Garden in San Andreas Valley,” and “Garden Outside Gate” are woven in the traditional Aubusson Style. The tapestries represent various gardens that the artist remembers from his years living in the Bay Area. Irises, hydrangeas, chrysanthemums, and wild dahlias are featured in rich deep shades of the rainbow.   See “Pond in Golden Gate Park,” “Garden in San Andreas Valley,” and “Garden Outside Gate” by Mark Adams, on display, pre-security, in Terminal 2. https://bit.ly/3SbIXsX",
