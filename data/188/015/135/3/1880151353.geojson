The same year, Hughes Airwest ceased operations for two months due to an employee strike at its San Francisco headquarters and was targeted it for a takeover by Republic. When Republic acquired Hughes Airwest the following year, the airline’s bright yellow fleet was repainted with Republic’s new colors and its “Herman the Duck” logo. In 1986, Republic was absorbed by Northwest Airlines, which in turn was merged into Delta Air Lines in 2010.",
