When the German army invaded the Netherlands in 1940, she immigrated to the United States and taught at the California College of Arts and Crafts (now the California College of the Arts) in Oakland. Two years later, she was the first resident at Pond Farm, an art colony and refuge for European artists near Guerneville in the Russian River Valley of Northern California. Although, the collaborative dissolved during the 1950s, Marguerite Wildenhain continued at Pond Farm, where she made studio ceramics and held annual summer workshops, teaching select students to master wheel-thrown pottery.
