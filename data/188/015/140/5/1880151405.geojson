        "body": "Tiffany \u0026 Company was America’s most distinguished artistic goods manufacturer and one of the first to adopt Japanese-influenced decoration, which was lauded as far as Europe and Japan. The company began importing Japanese works under the guidance of designer Edward C. Moore (1827–91). Moore amassed a large collection of Japanese art, including ceramics, textiles, and metalwork that was later bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also established Tiffany’s study collection and library. Most likely, Moore commissioned Christopher Dresser (1834–1904) to assemble a collection of objects during his tour of Japan in 1876–77. Dresser acquired and shipped 160 crates containing almost two thousand works of Japanese art in a variety of mediums to the firm.
