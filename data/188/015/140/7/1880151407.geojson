        "body": "The Shona are the largest Indigenous group in Zimbabwe. Ancestral Shona built Great Zimbabwe, a medieval city, entirely from stone over a thousand years ago. The Shona also live in the neighboring countries of Mozambique and Zambia. Shona language is part of the Bantu language group and includes several dialects. Shona traditions have evolved over time, but aspects of traditional Shona culture still thrive in rural areas. Historically known for their beautifully carved wooden headrests, the Shona also have a rich tradition of handcrafted basketry, pottery, instruments, tools, textiles, and jewelry. The Shona worldview is communicated through traditional folktales, proverbs, myths, legends, and songs. For most Shona, the spirit world of the ancestors is ever-present. Mwari, the supreme being, appointed other spirits to act as mediators, such as vadzimu (ancestral spirits) and mhondoro (a spirit that watches over the entire settlement). The Shona communicate with spirits through a spirit medium.  The art of stone sculpture in Zimbabwe is ever evolving, with thousands of sculptors working in Harare and throughout the country. Each sculpture expresses the artistâ€™s imagination and ingenuity. The selected work in our exhibition reflects the diversity of approaches by twenty-first century artists working in the tradition of Zimbabwean stone sculpture.  See \"Stone Sculpture of Zimbabwe\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/ZimbabweSculpture",
