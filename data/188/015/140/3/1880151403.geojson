        "body": "Airmail became a driving force in the development of commercial aviation after World War I, and airmail envelopes and letters were instant souvenirs of new routes and first flights. Called flight covers, these artifacts serve as tangible proof of major aeronautical achievements and are touchstones to the past. In many cases, these covers are the only surviving physical objects from historic flights. In addition to the official postage stamp, cancellation mark, and postmark showing date and place, is the unique imprint called a cachet—a hand stamped or machine printed design commemorating a fight operation. Cachets range in sophistication from simple and handmade to fancy, multicolor depictions. Many covers also bear flight crew signatures. Aerophilately—the collecting and study of airmail—continues to be a popular pursuit. Today, these rare surviving airmail flight covers document how the air route across the Pacific Ocean was established during the 1920s and 30s, and then strengthened in the postwar era with the introduction of more advanced aircraft making non-stop travel between the United States and Australia a reality.   Featuring rare surviving airmail flight covers that document how the air route across the Pacific Ocean was established during the 1920s and 30s, “Airmail Down Under” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library, located on the departures level of the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/3wz8Z1T",
