The china featured the “Alice Springs” pattern with the Qantas winged-kangaroo logo in gold and complemented with a gold-lined border. Inflight meals during the decade often included premium Australian beef and shellfish, as well as wines from “Down Under.”  See “Flying the Southern Cross Route: Seventy-Five years of Australian Commercial Air Service to North America” on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and online at: https://bit.ly/3BnvkPy",
