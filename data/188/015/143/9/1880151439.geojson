        "body": "In 1925, Dorr Bothwell became a charter member of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists. Three years later, Bothwell sailed for Pago Pago, Samoa, with intentions to create art and immerse herself in native culture. She lived on the island of Ta`ū as the adopted daughter of a local chief and his family for two years. Bothwell sketched, painted, and made woodblock prints, which she shipped back to California to fund travels in Australia and Europe.   During the late 1930s, Bothwell worked as a designer and muralist for modernist painter Lorser Feitelson (1898–1978) under the Works Progress Administration in Los Angeles. She began teaching in San Francisco at the California School of Fine Arts in 1944 and continued instructing at the San Francisco Art Institute from 1959–1996. Dorr Bothwell moved to Mendocino in 1961, where she established a studio and taught at the Mendocino Art Center until 1997.
