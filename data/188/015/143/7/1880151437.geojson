The airliner has a capacity of between two-hundred and three-hundred passengers and the range for most transoceanic routes, it also featured a “glass cockpit,” or all-digital LCD flight instrument display panels.  In production for over forty years, more than 1,200 of the aircraft have been—and continue to be!—built. Fun fact about the Boeing 767: it is the only Boeing airliner that is made in freighter, passenger and tanker versions.",
