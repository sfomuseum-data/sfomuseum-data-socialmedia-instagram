        "body": "The pineapple plant, known all over the world for its delicious fruit, is indigenous to Central and South America. The pineapple has a lengthy history in the Philippines, where it was likely introduced by the Spanish in the late sixteenth century. The country’s fertile soil and suitable climate allowed for the rapid spread of the plant. The Philippines remains one of the leading distributors and exporters of preserved and fresh pineapple products today.   The Philippines is the only country that utilizes pineapple leaves to create lavishly embroidered piña cloth. When pineapples are cultivated for fibers, the fruit is removed early in the growing stage so that the leaves receive more nourishment and reach greater lengths. The best fibers are produced when the plant is grown in shady areas.   See \"From Pineapple to Piña: A Philippine Textile Treasure\" on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/PineappletoPina",
