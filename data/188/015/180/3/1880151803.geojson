        "body": "It’s your last week to see “Mathematics: Vintage and Modern!”  From the 1870s to around World War I, universities in Europe and North America acquired collections of mathematical models made from plaster, metal, paper, wood, and string. These models allowed students to see the geometry of complex functions, revolutionary to mathematics at the time. German mathematicians Felix Klein (1849–1925) and Alexander Brill (1842–1935) created some of the earliest models. Klein displayed a number of them at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago to promote the idea that students must visualize algebraic relationships through geometry. Today, algebraic geometry serves as a source of deep insight throughout mathematics.
