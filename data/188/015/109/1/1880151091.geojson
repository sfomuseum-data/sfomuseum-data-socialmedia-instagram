        "body": "“My work really is about a weathered history of our journey on this planet—the cycle of birth, life, death and regeneration.” – Leonardo Drew  Using off-the-shelf materials and the occasional found object, Leonardo Drew (b. 1961) creates sculptures whose metaphorical power is located within his labor-intensive manipulation of materials and the spatial dynamics of his compositions. Drew intends his work to resonate with a wide cross-section of viewers, who carry within themselves a multitude of life experiences. The individual components of Number 69S are all remnants from past work in various stages of distress, which bear the mark of time and help to trigger memories.   See “Number 69S” by Leonardo Drew on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/39M3IWv",
