        "body": "Celebrating its ninetieth season in 2023, San Francisco Ballet is one of the most influential ballet companies in the world. Founded as the San Francisco Opera Ballet in 1933, its initial purpose was to train dancers to appear in opera productions. The Company separated from the Opera in 1942 and was renamed San Francisco Ballet.   Between 1995 and 2023, five choreographic festivals were curated by Helgi Tomasson, the Company’s former artistic director. This exhibition features costumes from ballets created by choreographers who were commissioned for these festivals, showing the breadth of repertoire and design created in San Francisco over the past four decades.  Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible. See “San Francisco Ballet at 90” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/SFBalletAt90",
