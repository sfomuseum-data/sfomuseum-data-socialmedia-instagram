Mills, grandson of the Gold Rush banker Darius Ogden Mills, allocated 150 acres of pastureland located twelve miles south of San Francisco’s Civic Center. The terms were for three years at the rate of $1,500 per year for this “temporary and experimental” municipal airport. This original tract of land remains part of SFO today.",
