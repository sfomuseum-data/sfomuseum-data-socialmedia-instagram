The image is collaged from printed sari cloth—a diasporic object that is rooted in Indian culture and suggests the movement of bodies. Included in the composition are depictions of the Arctic Tern, known for its long yearly migration, and the hummingbird, which is native to the Americas.  See “When the Path Through the Atmosphere is Longer” by Ranu Mukherjee is on display, post-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/3IPewHo",
