Designed to replace the Douglas D-3, the Convair 240 was the first pressurized, twin-engine airliner, put into service. Named the 240 after its twin engine and 40 seating capacity, 75 were ordered by American Airlines and 50 more were ordered by Continental Air Lines, Pan American World Airways, KLM, Trans-Australia Airlines, and Western Air Lines. Western named its CV-240 service the “49er.” It featured a built-in, drop-down stairway for quick passenger loading, petal-style engine cowlings for rapid maintenance, and tricycle-landing gear. Have you ever flown on the Convair CV-240?  #AvGeek #Convair #WesternAirLines  photograph: Western Air Lines, Convair CV-240; 1948 Gift of Barbara A. Dawson 2000.073.010",
