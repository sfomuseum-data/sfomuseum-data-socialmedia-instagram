        "body": "Ruth Kadish was the first woman to serve on the San Francisco Airport Commission upon being appointed in 1976 by Mayor George Moscone; she served until 1984. Educated and trained as a counselor, she was a founding member of SCOPE (Service Committee for Public Education) and served on the board of the San Francisco YMCA. Kadish was a champion for humanizing and beautifying the airport environment. Her impact and achievements included replacing all of the artificial plants within the terminals with live plants, pushing for shops and restaurants to reflect San Francisco’s unique culture, encouraging the implementation of light and airy open spaces into its architectural design, and—our favorite!—initiating the arts exhibition program, which became SFO Museum.  She maintained “that if the surroundings were attractive as well as functional it would help diminish people's tension.”   #52Objects #RuthKadish #SFOHistory #WomenHistoryMonth #AvGeek  photographs: San Francisco International Airport (SFO); 1970s Transfer from San Francisco International Airport 1997.52.083.029  http://bit.ly/3Tk4FgE",
