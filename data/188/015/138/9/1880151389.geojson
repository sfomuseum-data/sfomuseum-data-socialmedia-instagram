        "body": "“What would you take with you if you had to leave home and could only take three things?” This was the question asked of beginning sculpture students at Notre Dame Belmont. The high school students worked with clay for the first time; but rather than a traditional vessel project, sculpture teacher Martha Anne Kuntz created the Luggage Project. Each student designed a piece of luggage with three meaningful objects to place inside. For many, thinking abstractly posed a challenge. How would you show your love for your family without depicting one’s family? From a childhood tree growing up and out of a suitcase, to a row of houses and three teacups—the photographs exhibited represent the work of Notre Dame Belmont students who challenged themselves to think beyond the obvious.  “The Luggage Project” by the students of Notre Dame Belmont is on display, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 1. https://bit.ly/3P7AiXA",
