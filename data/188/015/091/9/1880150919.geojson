        "body": "Clara Barck Welles (1868–1965) founded the Kalo Shop in 1900 with five other women graduates of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. They chose the name Kalo from a Greek word meaning “to make beautiful.” Their motto was to create “beautiful, useful, and enduring” objects. Initially, the women designed a variety of crafts in several mediums. Before long, the Kalo Shop burgeoned into one of the most influential American handwrought silver manufacturers of the Arts and Crafts movement, producing a tremendous range of holloware, flatware, and jewelry.  This exhibition celebrates Welles’ Kalo Shop, the Chicago area’s largest and most successful Arts and Crafts silversmith firm, long respected for its refined aesthetic.  \"A New Woman: Clara Barck Welles, Inspiration \u0026 Influence in Arts \u0026 Crafts Silver\" was organized by the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art at the University of Oregon with support from Margo Grant Walsh. The original exhibition was planned in collaboration with Marilyn Archer, Curatorial and Design Consultant, and Margo Grant Walsh, Consultant. Thank you also to Sharon S. Darling and Darcy L. Evon for their scholarship.  See \"A New Woman: Clara Barck Welles, Inspiration \u0026 Influence in Arts \u0026 Crafts Silver\" on display pre-security in the Mayor Edwin M. Lee International Terminal Departures Hall and online at: https://bit.ly/BarckWelles",
