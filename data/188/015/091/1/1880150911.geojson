        "body": "Choreographer Arthur Pita’s 𝘉𝘫ö𝘳𝘬 𝘉𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘵 celebrates the theatricality of Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk. Björk’s music provides a framework for fragmented stories. A lone fisherman provides a ghost of a narrative and, because Björk’s music often references nature, a link to the natural world. Woven around the fisherman’s tale are snippets of love stories. Ultimately, Pita explains, Björk Ballet is about “birth, life, sex, and death.”  Throughout 𝘉𝘫ö𝘳𝘬 𝘉𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘵, Pita’s choreography for its twenty-two dancers mixes kicks, lunges, and squats with classically inspired technique. In trying to capture Björk’s essence, Pita goes to extremes with his movement. There are cantilevered duets with an underwater quality and a classically based octet, set to 𝘍𝘳𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘪, that Pita says, “should look like a ballerina music box on acid.” 𝘏𝘺𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘣𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘢𝘥, Pita’s ballet rave, entails a long jumping sequence set to a pumping, driving rhythm. “It’s a metaphor—jumping for joy, jumping for love,” says Pita.   Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
