These objects are rendered in an uncanny fashion with a sense of play, emotional intuition, and surrealism that provokes viewers to reimagine themselves and the way they view the world around them.  See “Time, Turn, and Light” by Woody De Othello on display, post-security on the Outdoor Terrace Observation Deck in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/3kiuVFq",
