I have been an activist and advocate for trans women of color and trans-identified individuals for the majority of my life. My sisters are dying. My sisters are not being connected… My life relies upon me being able to give to my community, and my reward is when I see people take what I have given to them and do something constructive with it.” - Caprice, 55, Chicago, IL, 2015  Representations of older transgender people are nearly absent from our culture and those that do exist are often one-dimensional. For over five years (2013–2018), photographer Jess T. Dugan and social worker Vanessa Fabbre traveled throughout the United States creating “To Survive on This Shore: Photographs and Interviews with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Older Adults.”   Each portrait in “To Survive on this Shore” by Jess T. Dugan and Vanessa Fabbre includes a powerful interview with each of the featured individual.   See “To Survive on this Shore” on display in the Ruth Kadish Gallery located in the post-security connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 and online at: http://bit.ly/3k4a26h",
