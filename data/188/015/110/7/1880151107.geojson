        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1803, Ohio was admitted into the Union. Happy Birthday Ohio! Dayton, Ohio is the home of pioneers of heavier-than-air powered flight, Orville and Wilbur Wright. After the brothers achieved their first heavier-than-air flights at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903, they returned to Dayton to find a suitable location for further experiments. They found a spot in the pastureland owned by Dayton banker, Torrence Huffman. Now part of the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the brothers used the Huffman Prairie Flying Field to develop the world's first practical airplane. The brothers’ company, The Wright Company, also used it as a testing ground and a flying school. Some of sites utilized by the Wright brothers’ are part of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park (@Daytonaviationnhp). Have you ever been to Ohio?",
