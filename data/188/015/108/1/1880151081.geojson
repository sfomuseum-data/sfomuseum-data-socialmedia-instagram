O’Malley distilled over one hundred interviews into vibrantly-colored text-based works. The inspirational words of these sixteen prints vary in content from the sincere to the silly and allude to the idea that the wisdom of our 80-year-old selves might already exist within us.  See “Advice from My 80-Year-Old-Self” by Susan O’Malley on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/3IoAEXN",
