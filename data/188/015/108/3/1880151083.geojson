Started by the National Museum of Women in Arts (@womeninthearts), #5WomenArtists calls attention to the fact that women are underrepresented in the art world and that many people can’t name even five female artists.   Want to learn about some amazing female artists? Our exhibition “California Modernist Women” features fifteen of them, including Ray Eames, Edith Heath, Zahara Schatz, Dorr Bothwell, and Ruth Asawa.   See “California Modernist Women: Groundbreaking Creativity” on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. https://bit.ly/CaliforniaModernistWomen",
