For the commission, Liang chose to create a “spiritual, abstract world,” he says, “what you would call the in-between, where it’s neither this world nor the next world. As a choreographer, I don’t want to limit audiences in what they see…I really want them to find themselves through it.” The concept coincides with his choice of music—Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninov’s (1873–1943) Symphonic Dances (1940)—the composer’s final major composition, which he wrote while living in the United States. “Some people would call it dark, but I consider it spiritual,” says Liang, who was drawn to the composition’s intensity and the fantasy world Rachmaninov created through the music. This is what Liang sought to emulate in his choreography.   Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
