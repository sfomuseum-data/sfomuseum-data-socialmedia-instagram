        "body": "Gateway” by Ik-Joong Kang contains 5,400 unique 3-inch by 3-inch paintings, wood carvings, tiles, and cast acrylic cubes. The artist began working in this format when he was a student and commuted long distances to various part-time jobs. The 3-inch canvases were small enough for him to carry in his backpack and paint on the subway.  See “Gateway” by Ik-Joong Kang on display, pre-security, in the Mayor Edwin M. Lee International Terminal Departures Hall and online at: https://bit.ly/32zWq6R",
