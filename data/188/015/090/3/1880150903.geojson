        "body": "Did you know Bernard M. “Mike” Doolin, the fourth director of the airport was also an accomplished aviator? After serving as a pilot in the United States Aviation Section, Signal Corps during the first World War, Doolin became the director of the airport from 1932 to 1950. Doolin was a frequent flyer/visitor to the airport even before his appointment, piloting a Boeing Model 40 NC381 and a Stearman 4 Junior Speedmail while working for the Standard Oil Company of California aviation division from 1928 to 1932. During Doolin’s 18 years at the airport, he was instrumental in helping to develop the master plan for the airport. He then moved on to become the state director of aeronautics for California. Doolin passed at the age of 76 in 1974.  #52Objects #SFOHistory #avgeek   photograph: Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco, Bernard M. “Mike” Doolin next to Stearman 4 Junior Speedmail; c. 1930 Gift of Keith Samuels, in memory of Margot Doolin Samuels 2013.099.023  https://bit.ly/3X4C3tA",
