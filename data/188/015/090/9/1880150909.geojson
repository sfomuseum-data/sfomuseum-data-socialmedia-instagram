        "body": "What did the Airport look like #onthisday in 1940? The 1937 Terminal and Hangars 1-4 are discernable, as are the runways. Beginning in 1935, as part of FDR’s New Deal, runway “C” was extended from 1,900 to 3,000 feet as part of a Works Progress Administration project. To compare, SFO’s runways currently measure between 7,650 and 11,870 feet. San Bruno residents will no doubt also spot the distinctive arched and heart-shaped streets around Cupid’s Row and the wide street of El Camino Real.",
