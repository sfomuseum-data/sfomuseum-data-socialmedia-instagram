As Pan American was not licensed to operate domestic routes within in the United States, the company purchased National Airlines in 1980. This would not prove be as good a financial takeover as the company anticipated. With skyrocketing oil prices, the once profitable routes National operated became unprofitable under Pan Am. The airline was forced to file for bankruptcy in early 1991 and flew its last flight on December 4, 1991.",
