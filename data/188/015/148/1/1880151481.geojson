        "body": "In the early 1940s, Pan American Airways established regular service to Auckland, New Zealand, with their Boeing 314 Clipper flying boats. Although this service was halted by the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific Ocean theater, the war years were transformational for transpacific air travel. Not only were new and improved aircraft developed, but a network of airfields was built across the Pacific basin as part of the war effort. In the late 1940s, land-based aircraft, like the Douglas DC-4 and the larger DC-6, as well as the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, made regularly operated commercial air routes between the United States and Australia a reality for airmail, cargo, and passengers alike.
