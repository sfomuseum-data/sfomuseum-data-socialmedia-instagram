In 1952, KLM began offering its first-class, long-haul passengers promotional giveaway Delftware gin bottles in the shape of traditional Dutch houses. By the 1960s, they also offered the houses as ashtrays, which were cleverly designed to allow the cigarette smoke to billow out the houseâ€™s chimney. Since then, the Holland-based ceramics manufacturer Delftware has produced one hundred and three #Delft Blue buildings.",
