        "body": "The María Clara served as the formal female ensemble of the Philippines in the late nineteenth century and was perfectly suited to the humid climate. The romantic outfit, often worn by mestizas or women of mixed Philippine and Spanish descent, combined Indigenous and Spanish influences.   Derived from the traditional female baro’t saya attire, the María Clara consists of a loose, long-sleeved blouse over a wide ankle-length skirt. The blouse or camisa, featured bell-shaped sleeves or “angel wings.” The puffy sleeves were often temporarily basted onto a camisa when worn, and then dismantled for washing, ironing, and flat storage. A pañuelo or square piece of cloth was folded several times and placed over the shoulders. Pañuelos, likely inspired by shawls, provided protection from the sun as well as modesty due to the camisa’s sheerness and low neckline. Simultaneously, they served as the most decorative accents due to their lavish handwork embellishments. A tapis, or overskirt, completed the outfit.
