        "body": "Our 1:10-scale cutaway model of a United Air Lines DC-8 was created by Pacific Miniatures to be a promotional presentation of the Jet Mainliner in miniature. Christened Mainliner Captain R.T. Freng, it represents the first DC-8-21 delivered to United.   The model has an incredibly detailed cockpit and cabin with features that accurately replicate the Jet Mainliner’s interior as designed by the industrial design firm of Raymond Loewy (1893–1986), even down to the red and teal patterned carpets. Its seats resemble the design of real ones and are placed in nearly identical configurations. The bulkheads, curtains, and windows are also similar to those in the aircraft. The model includes the first class “Red Carpet Room” lounge, where a boy is portrayed stacking blocks to emphasize the smooth and stable flight characteristics of the jetliner.   See “Jet Mainliner in Miniature: The United Air Lines Douglas DC-8 Cutaway Model” on display, in the Aviation Museum, located pre-security in the International Terminal or online at: https://bit.ly/3AEyqiS",
