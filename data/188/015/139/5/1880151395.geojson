        "body": "“Geneva” is an ongoing series by photographer Kari Orvik that offers a glimpse into San Francisco’s Outer Mission neighborhood at the corner of Mission Street and Geneva Avenue. This has been the location of the artist’s tintype portrait studio for the past eight years. A resident of the Mission for over twenty years, Orvik has developed relationships with other residents and small business owners in the neighborhood, photographing them both on the street corner and in her studio.  The series is a personal inquiry and a poetic interpretation of place across multiple photographic formats. Orvik uses 19th-century wet plate collodion processes on metal and glass plates, traditional black and white and color film, and digital formats. By incorporating historic photographic processes into her contemporary imagery, Orvik considers our present in relation to the city’s past.   See “Geneva” by Kari Orvik on display in the Ruth Kadish Gallery, located in the post-security connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, and online at: https://bit.ly/3MjrKM8",
