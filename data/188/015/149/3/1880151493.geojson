        "body": "The individual patterns of this Persian ceiling paper set were drawn and adapted from examples of the Persian and Indo-Persian patterns depicted in Albert Racinet’s compendium L’Ornement Polychrome, published in installments between 1869 and 1873. A French costume historian, illustrator, painter, and author, Racinet (1825–93) worked as an engraver and artistic director for the French publisher Firmin-Didot et Cie. The success of L’Ornement Polychrome prompted a second series in 1885. The lavish imagery presented in both sets drew from cultures around the world and featured a variety of mediums, including woodwork, metalwork, architecture, textiles, painting, and pottery.   International exhibitions of Islamic and other non-Western arts helped fuel European and American interest in and desire for these styles, as did the collections of early museums, such as the British Museum in London (1753) and the Louvre in Paris (1793).   Special thank you to Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers for making this exhibition possible. “The Victorian Papered Wall” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/VictorianPaperedWall",
