        "body": "Anthony Cruz Legarda (b. 1963) (@anthonycruzlegarda), a Filipino American fashion designer, pursued a degree in Fashion Merchandising at City College of San Francisco and graduated in Fashion Design from the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Fabrics in his collections are handwoven, embellished, and dyed with natural pigments by Indigenous master weavers from the Philippines. The piña and piña silk fabrics from Legarda‘s collections were handwoven in Kalibo, Aklan, Philippines. The hand embroidery was completed in Lumban, Laguna, Philippines.   Legarda’s clothing encourages the development of eco-entrepreneurship and sustainable fashion by honoring traditional methodologies and fair trade with native artisans. His signature textile is piña, and he has played a pivotal role in incorporating the fabric into high fashion designs, including bridal gowns, women’s couture, and men’s shirts.
