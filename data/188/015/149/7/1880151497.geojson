        "body": "Edith Heath (1911–2005) created ceramics that combined modern design with the hand-made aesthetics of studio pottery. Initially, Heath aspired to teach and completed her credential in art education at Chicago Teacher’s College. In the early 1940s, she moved west and took classes in ceramics at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) and the University of California, Berkeley. Heath converted the laundry room of her Filbert Street residence into a pottery studio, and by 1944 she exhibited at the Legion of Honor Museum and sold wares to the high-end San Francisco retailer Gump’s. Demand quickly surpassed supply, and with manufacturing equipment designed by her husband Brian Heath (1913–2001), the couple made simple and elegant housewares and tiles at their eponymous factory in Sausalito, California, for over fifty years.
