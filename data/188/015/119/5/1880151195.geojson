Gorham’s chief designer George Wilkinson (1819–94) embraced Japanese modes to create a variety of artistic silver. Gorham was the first American manufacturer to perfect and market Japanese-inspired objects of red copper with silver appliqués, hand wrought, hammered, and engraved by their silversmiths.
