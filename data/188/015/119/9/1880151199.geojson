Piloting small planes, paramotors, and gyrocopters, he has spent more than five thousand solo hours above the Polish landscape near his hometown of Gdynia on the Baltic Sea. In his series, “Event Horizon,” Kowalski examines the vast frozen landscapes and bodies of water of northern Poland during winter flights in his gyrocopter and paramotor.   See “Event Horizon” by Kacper Kowalski (@kacperkowalski_photography) on display, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 3 and online at: https://bit.ly/3i2BZKP",
