        "body": "Qantas (Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services) is one of the oldest continually operating airlines in the world; it celebrated its centennial in 2020. The airline was founded in 1920 by Paul McGinness (1896–1952), Hudson Fysh (1895–1974), Fergus McMaster (1879–1950), and Arthur Baird (1889–1954). In 1934, in a joint venture with Imperial Airways, Qantas Empire Airways was formed. After World War II, Qantas Empire Airways was nationalized and began rapidly expanding its route system. International routes with Douglas DC-4 airliners were established to Manila, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. New, advanced, long-range aircraft, beginning with the Lockheed L-749 Constellation in 1947, were also acquired, which enabled the airline to fly the long-distance “Kangaroo Route” to London. With the acquisition of BCPA (British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines) in 1954, Qantas added BCPA’s transpacific “Southern Cross Route” from Australia to America.   “Flying the Southern Cross Route: Seventy-Five years of Australian Commercial Air Service to North America” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library, located on the departures level of the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/3oyMqFX",
