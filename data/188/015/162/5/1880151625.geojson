        "body": "The quality of nineteenth-century piña textiles and embroidery is unsurpassed. The embroidery industry thrived in the early twentieth century, particularly as an export industry encouraged by American colonists who occupied the Philippines from 1898 to 1946. Many women and girls learned lace making, embroidery, and crochet and supplemented the income of their families by creating a variety of household linens. Piña remains a distinct Philippine product, popular in the West as high-end linens, souvenirs, handbags, handkerchiefs, and other accessory items.
