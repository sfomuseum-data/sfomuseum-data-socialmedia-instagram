        "body": "Zimbabwean artists carve their sculptures from the indigenous stone that permeates the country and exhibits an array of hues. Some of this stone comes from the Great Dyke, a 2.5-billion-year-old linear geological feature of metal-bearing rock that spans the center of Zimbabwe. Many of the sculptures in this exhibition are made from one of two locally sourced stonesâ€”opal stone or springstone. Opal stone is a softer, milky-light-green or brownish serpentine with a fine, smooth texture and nearly translucent surface that may be speckled with other colors. Sculptors enjoy using it because it is not as hard as springstone and polishes to a high sheen with a rich coloring and texture. Springstone, on the other hand, is one of the hardest serpentine stones used in carving and also displays a high sheen when polished.   See \"Stone Sculpture of Zimbabwe\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/ZimbabweSculpture",
