He graduated from Yale University and briefly worked on Wall Street before starting Long Island Airways in 1922. During the mid-1920s, he served as general manager of Colonial Air Transport, which attained the first U.S. airmail contract. In 1927, he formed Pan American Airways as by consolidating three existing airlines. Pan Am’s first flight was a mail delivery from Florida to Cuba in October of the same year.   Over the next five decades, with Trippe’s vision and entrepreneurial zeal, Pan Am became an innovative business model that became the blueprint for the global air transport system. Its unrivaled string of aviation firsts included first commercial air service across oceans, first successful jet service, first widebody service, and a worldwide system of subsidiaries and partnership businesses related to the aviation industry.",
