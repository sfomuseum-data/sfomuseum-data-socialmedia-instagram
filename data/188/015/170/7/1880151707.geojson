        "body": "Christian Herter (1839–83) arrived in New York from Germany in 1859 and became a full partner in his brother Gustave’s firm in 1864, forming Herter Brothers. In 1870, his brother returned to Germany, and Christian served as the firm’s artistic director. During this time, the large firm created interiors for some of the most magnificent homes across the country, including William H. Vanderbilt’s residence on Fifty-First Street and Fifth Avenue. Herter Brothers’ holistic approach included designs for furniture and woodwork, wall and ceiling decoration, as well as floor treatments and draperies. In 1878, Christian Herter registered designs for a dozen wallpapers at the U.S. Patent Office. Many of the patterns drew inspiration from Japan, as did much of the company’s furniture. One wallpaper patent featured a design of peacock feathers; another fill paper and frieze exhibited floral and animal motifs on a dark background. The Herter Brothers showroom in New York City offered Herter’s original designs for wallpaper alongside those of leading Aesthetic Movement designers from England. This Herter Brothers suite of papers is inspired by the firm’s designs.  Special thank you to Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers for making this exhibition possible. “The Victorian Papered Wall” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/VictorianPaperedWall",
