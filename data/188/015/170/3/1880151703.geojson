        "body": "Light and airy, the María Clara served as the formal female ensemble of the Philippines in the late nineteenth century and was perfectly suited to the humid climate. The attire derives from the traditional female “baro’t saya”, which consists of a loose, long-sleeved blouse over a wide ankle-length skirt.  The María Clara consists of a blouse or camisa, which has bell-shaped sleeves or “angel wings,” a long skirt or saya, and a pañuelo or square piece of cloth folded several times and placed over the shoulders. The puffy sleeves were often temporarily basted onto a camisa when worn, and then dismantled for washing, ironing, and flat storage.   Simultaneously, they served as the most decorative accents due to their lavish handwork embellishments. A tapis, or overskirt, completed the outfit.  Fun fact: The name María Clara comes from the female heroine in the novel “Noli Me Tángere”, written in 1887 by the Filipino author José Rizal (1861–96).
