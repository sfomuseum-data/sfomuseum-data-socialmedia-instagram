Herrmann collected autographs from notable people she met while working. One of her souvenirs was this paper (the back side of a blank airline property damage report form) signed by members of San Francisco Giantsâ€™ 1963 team. Notable names include left fielder Willie McCovey, for whom McCovey Cove is named after, and center fielder Willie Mays, who is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time.   #Giants #AvGeek #SFHistory #autograph #crewlife  souvenir autographs: United Air Lines, Sandra L.
