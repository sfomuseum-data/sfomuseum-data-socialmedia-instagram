Varney, a flight school and air taxi operator from San Francisco, founded Varney Air Lines, which began airmail service #onthisday in 1926. After Varney Air Lines was purchased by United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in 1930, Varney started a new business, Varney Speed Lines, in 1934. Varney Speed Lines would go on to become Continental Air Lines three years later. The two companies Varney started would merge into one when United and Continental combined in 2010.   Happy birthday, United!",
