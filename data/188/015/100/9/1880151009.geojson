        "body": "Kacper Kowalski is a photographer and aviator who has been observing and photographing landscapes from above for over twenty-five years. Flying at altitudes below five hundred feet near his hometown of Gdynia, Poland on the Baltic Sea, Kowalski shrewdly limits context and visual cues in order to shift his detailed aerial images into the realm of abstraction. Through his lens, the landscape adopts a multitude of new meanings and associations—frozen coastlines become rhythmic and lyrical; melting ice sheets appear both microscopic and inconceivably vast; scenes of windswept tundra recall imagery of distant galaxies.   See “Event Horizon” by Kacper Kowalski on display, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 3 and online at: https://bit.ly/3i2BZKP",
