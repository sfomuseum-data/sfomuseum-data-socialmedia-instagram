        "body": "Pheoleen Gandari’s (b. 1979) interest in art began during grade school at Zengeza in Chitungwiza, a township in Harare. While in school, Gandari was inspired to carve stone by Newman Chikuni (b. 1956), a senior artist at the Chitungwiza Arts Centre whose work has been featured at the National Gallery in Harare. Gandari began assisting Chikuni on the weekends and was soon creating his own sculptures. Gandari shared a workshop with a fellow artist until joining the Chitungwiza Art Centre in 2001. Gandari tries to capture the emotion associated with daily life and events. His work appears in collections around the world, including UNESCO, where his sculpture is part of the United Nations Art Collection. In his sculpture, “Kneeling Woman,” Gandari skillfully leaves the hair unpolished to create a beautiful texture that contrasts with the body’s rich green sheen.  See \"Stone Sculpture of Zimbabwe\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/ZimbabweSculpture",
