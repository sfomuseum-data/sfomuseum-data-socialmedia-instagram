For “The End of the Plain Plane” campaign, designer #AlexanderGirard (1907–1993) introduced a vivid color pallet, while Italian-born fashion impresario #EmilioPucci (1914–1992) re-conceptualized the airline uniform. Pucci’s 1965 Gemini IV Collection was multi-layered for inflight quick-change combinations of suits, tunics, and culottes. Pucci then introduced this 1966 Supersonic Derby outfit. The harlequin-print nylon jersey, tights, and bowler hat have Central American instruments and pre-Columbian art motifs. Footwear designer #BethLevine (1914–2006) created the striped calfskin boots.  See this fantastic outfit and other outfits by #EmilioPucci in “#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design”, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
