        "body": "The Taj Mahal, a Mughal monument and tomb, is located along the southern bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River in Agra, India. The great Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1592–1666), who reigned between 1628 and 1658, commissioned it in 1631 to commemorate his deceased wife. An outstanding example of Mughal architecture, it took more than twenty years to complete and is one of the most celebrated architectural structures in the world. The entirely white marble monument displays Indian, Persian, and Islamic influences.  A number of superbly illustrated books made by European travelers and artists in the early nineteenth century helped fuel the British public’s fascination with foreign locales. In an era before photography, over-sized tomes, depicted the stunning landscapes and historic architecture of India. Potters in Britain, recognizing the success of these foreign scenes began using images from these scenic publications on ceramics.  See more prints and the ceramics inspired by them in \"From #PrintToPlate: Views of the East on Transferware\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/PrintToPlate",
