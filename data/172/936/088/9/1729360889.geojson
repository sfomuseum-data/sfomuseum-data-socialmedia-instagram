In her home country of Honduras, Munguia worked as a laundress and was instantly attracted to tapestries, quilting, and weaving when she joined @creativityexplored in 2013. Munguia is a dedicated artist, meditatively sewing together baskets, assembling complex figurative tapestries, or embroidering quilts with lyrical, meandering lines.",
