The reality was that because the actors were reading their lines alone in a recording studio as opposed to interacting with each other as they would in a live-action film, the actors could read their lines dozens of times in dozens of ways to allow for the director and animators to choose the best inflections and intonations when matched with readings from the other actors. “Toy Story at Twenty” is on display everyday, 24 hours a day, pre-security, in the International Terminal or check out our online exhibition at http://www.flysfo.com/museum/exhibitions/toy-story-twenty. #ToyStory20  Andy Bud Luckey  Sid  Shelley Daniels Lekven  Early Buzz Pete Docter  Early Woody Bud Luckey",
