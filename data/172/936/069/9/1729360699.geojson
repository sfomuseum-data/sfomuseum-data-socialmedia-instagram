        "body": "This is your last chance to catch \"Queen of the Skies: The Legacy of the Lockheed Constellation\"! This passenger seat was designed and created by TECO Inc. of Burbank, California, exclusively for use by TWA in the Lockheed 1049G or, “Super G,” Constellation, introduced in 1955. It was touted as one of the most spacious and comfortable seats to be installed in an airliner at the time. It included deep-foam-rubber cushioning, upholstered armrests with built-in ashtrays, and large seatback pockets. It had a multi-position, cable-activated reclining mechanism, and also featured one of the first uses of molded Fiberglas side covers. The color and materials were designed to harmonize with the luxurious cabin interiors designed by the firm of Henry Dreyfuss Associates. The fabric was carefully coordinated with the cabin’s interior color scheme, and the headrest was usually covered with a removable cloth or “antimacassar.” Most Constellation seating was laid out in double- or triple-seat configurations with room for a lone single-seat located in the front of the “Super G” cabin. \"Queen of the Skies: The Legacy of the Lockheed Constellation\" is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. Located, pre-security, in the International Terminal, the Aviation Museum and Library is open daily, from 10am to 4:30pm, excluding holidays. http://bit.ly/TWASkyliner #TWASkyliner  TWA (Trans World Airlines) Lockheed L1049G Super Constellation cabin passenger seat  c. 1955 SFO Museum Gift of The Airline History Museum, Kansas City, Missouri 2000.093.001 a",
