        "body": "Dan Miller of Creative Growth Art Center is a featured artist in our current exhibition \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\". Miller’s artwork reflects his perceptions: letters and words are repeatedly overdrawn, often creating ink-layered masses, hovering on the page and built up to the point of obliteration or destruction of the ground. Each work contains the written recording of the artist’s obsession with objects like light bulbs, electrical sockets, food, and the names of cities and people. See him in action in this great 5-minute video titled “Crack the Lightbulb”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzvxjCT8g7I \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
