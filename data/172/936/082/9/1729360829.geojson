        "body": "“Sanctuary/Sanctuario” by Juana Alicia \u0026 Emmanuel C. Montoya is a family portrait of the Bay Area, a place rich with many different cultures. Just as arrival at SFO is the beginning of a new life for many immigrants, it is also a refuge to many shore birds that flock annually to surrounding wetlands. The mural is painted in traditional “fresco buono,” an ancient painting technique that mixes pigment directly into wet plaster. See “Sanctuary/Sanctuario” by Juana Alicia \u0026 Emmanuel C. Montoya, post-security, in the International Terminal, Boarding Area G, near Gate 97. http://bit.ly/1qIIMJk #AirportArt  Sanctuary/Sanctuario  2000 Juana Alicia \u0026 Emmanuel C.
