In the early 1930s, this was about the time it took to fly between the two cities. TWA was among the first airlines to operate a route from San Francisco Airport as early as 1933. The innovation of air transport changed the way business was conducted between the two cities: Passengers could now take a four-hour flight from either location and have time remaining in their workday to conduct business. A typical round-trip fare on TWA in 1933 from SF to LA was $34.11, or more than $600 today. #TravelTuesday  Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air (TWA) timetable 1933 SFO Museum Collection Gift of Thomas G.
