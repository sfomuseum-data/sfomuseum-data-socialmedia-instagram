        "body": "Los Angeles is only about 380 miles from San Francisco, but who would trade a four-hour plane ride for a lengthy train journey of over twelve hours? In the early 1930s, this was about the time it took to fly between the two cities. TWA was among the first airlines to operate a route from San Francisco Airport as early as 1933. The innovation of air transport changed the way business was conducted between the two cities: Passengers could now take a four-hour flight from either location and have time remaining in their workday to conduct business. A typical round-trip fare on TWA in 1933 from SF to LA was $34.11, or more than $600 today. #TravelTuesday  Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air (TWA) timetable 1933 SFO Museum Collection Gift of Thomas G.
