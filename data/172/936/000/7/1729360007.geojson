The Lockheed 1049 Super Constellation was an improved, long-range, stretched version of the 049 Constellation. The Super Constellation was designed primarily to compete with the Douglas DC-6 on transatlantic routes. The cabin design was developed by the industrial design firm of Henry Dreyfuss Associates. Divided into four sections, it was conceived to minimize the effect of the long-tube view when looking down the cabin. The interiors could also be arranged in a multitude of color and fabric combinations.
