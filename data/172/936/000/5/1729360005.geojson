The Boeing 707 was the worldâ€™s first viable commercial jetliner and revolutionized the airline industry while effectively ushering in the jet age. #OnThisDay in 1957, the first Boeing 707 took flight from Renton Municipal Airport. N708PA, the aircraft that took this first test flight, was delivered to Pan American World Airways on November 30, 1958. By October 1983, Pan American and TWA retired their Boeing 707s. Did you ever fly on a 707?",
