This United brochure features the favorite recipes from eleven Mainliner chefs. “In this unique booklet the collective creative ability of United Air Lines’ famous chefs is demonstrated for the first time in print. Some of these recipes are for appetizers, entrees, desserts, etc., which you have enjoyed on your Mainliner flights. Others are for dishes on which one the fortunate families and friends of our chefs have dined. But all of them are the favorite recipes of these ‘artists of the flight kitchen.’\" #United Air Lines brochure, “Favorite #Recipes of #Mainliner Chefs” 1954 SFO Museum Collection Anonymous gift 2016.143.001",
