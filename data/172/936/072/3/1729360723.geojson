        "body": "A trip on the Martin M-130 China Clipper in 1937 included five stops from San Francisco to Hong Kong: Honolulu; Midway Island; Wake Island; Guam; and Manila, Philippines. Passenger counts on the San Francisco–Honolulu leg rarely exceeded six or seven. With any more, luggage had to be sent by ship. Twelve passengers were the maximum. The length of the San Francisco–Honolulu flight—eighteen to twenty-two hours depending on winds—required sleeping births. Cabin interiors included dining and passenger lounges. Each trip from San Francisco to Hong Kong took six days with more than seventy hours of flying time. Building on that pioneering achievement over the last seven decades, air service between North America and Asia now takes little more than half a day.
