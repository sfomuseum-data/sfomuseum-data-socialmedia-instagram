        "body": "Photographer Tamara Danoyan’s inspiration for “Inner Circle” came from observing how light can make heavy and solid industrial objects appear ethereal and otherworldly. Large pipes become architectural spaces. Light enters through openings like it would through windows. Light reflected off of surfaces and diffused by plastic becomes more visible. A physical environment starts to feel celestial and evokes an elevated state of consciousness. Circles and curves are reminiscent of an ensō—a Japanese Zen circle. For Danoyan, light illuminates dark passages of the psyche. The circles symbolize an eternal desire to be whole, complete, and to feel connected to the Universe.  Tamara Danoyan’s “Inner Circle” is on display, pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1WvdBPc",
