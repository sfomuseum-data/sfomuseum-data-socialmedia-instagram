        "body": "One of the most significant figures in the Art Nouveau movement, glassmaker Emile Gallé (1846–1904) combined naturalistic designs with innovative techniques. He developed a process to create cut and incised flash glass and increased the vibrancy of his glass colors while retaining the material’s transparency. At the height of his firm’s productivity during the 1890s, his workshop employed nearly 300 associates. Some of his firm’s pieces were specially commissioned, while others could be chosen from a catalog or purchased at specialized retailers. Gallé’s workshops combined handcrafted techniques and industrial production to offer a variety of decorative objects.",
