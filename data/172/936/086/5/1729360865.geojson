        "body": "Thirty-five years ago, photographer and educator Janet Delaney created the photography project, South of Market, about San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood. Referred to locally as SoMa, the area was a raw and gritty working-class neighborhood at the time of Delaney’s original project. Today, SoMa is a dynamic and complicated hub for technology firms, luxury apartment buildings, and a significant population of impoverished or homeless people. As the tech industry redefines the urban landscape in SoMa, Delaney revisited the neighborhood and documented a transformation that she could not have imagined in the 1980s. Simultaneously delighted and stunned by these changes, she used her camera to bear witness to the neighborhood’s gentrification. See Janet Delaney’s “SoMa Now”, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 2.  http://www.flysfo.com/museum/exhibitions/janet-delaney-soma-now",
