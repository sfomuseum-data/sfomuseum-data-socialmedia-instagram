        "body": "On August 27, 1954, the new Central Terminal at SFO was dedicated. The terminal employed an innovative two-level design. The upper level was for departures and the lower level was for arrivals, each with its own roadway. The Public Health Service, Immigration, and Customs areas were located at the end of Concourse \"D\". A spacious restaurant named the International Room provided panoramic views of the airfield. In addition to the new radar, radio, and lighting systems, airfield improvements at the time included parallel runways for simultaneous take-off and landings.  As SFO had reached 2 million passengers flying in and out of the airport in 1952, the new terminal building was built with the facilities to accommodate several million passengers. The Central Terminal dedication ceremony was a three-day event that drew hundreds of thousands of visitors.  The Central Terminal has been modified several time since its conception, but it is still part of SFO as Terminal 2. #SFOHistory  San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Terminal Building opening day 1954 SFO Museum Collection Gift of William T.
