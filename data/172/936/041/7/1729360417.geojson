For their fifth trip, they acquired two Sikorsky amphibians and flew the length of the continent capturing unique photographic images and film footage, including of the Serengeti migrations and Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya. After Martin perished in 1937, Osa wrote “I Married Adventure”, which was also made into a feature-length movie in 1940. #WomenInAviation  Learn more about Osa and Martin Johnson in \"#TerraCognito: Published Works of Discovery by Aerial Explorers\" on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal.
