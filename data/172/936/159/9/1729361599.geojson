        "body": "Coming Soon! Our newest exhibition will be The Nation's Game: The @nfl the @profootballhof in Terminal 3. It opens on September 19, 2015 and runs until February 28, 2016. ‪#‎TheNationsGame‬  Today, we installed this San Francisco 49ers Football Field Vehicle from the San Francisco @49ers Museum at @levisstadium presented by @sony.  This San Francisco 49ers Football Field Vehicle was inspired by the “football buggies” of previous decades, which featured a large version of each team’s helmet covering an electrically powered cart. Its primary function was medical transportation to safely remove injured players from the field during home games at Candlestick Park. The pickup truck-style bed allowed players to be transported comfortably while being accompanied by team medical staff. Custom storage areas in the bed provided space for team medical staff to keep various supplies and equipment. The 49ers field vehicle was a staple feature during community appearances, charity events, annual summer training camps, and staff holiday parties until its retirement in the mid-2000s.",
