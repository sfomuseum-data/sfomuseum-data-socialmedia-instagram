This month Virgin America is expanding its service from San Francisco to Honolulu and Sir Richard Branson came to SFO to kick off the festivities. Since the dawn of aviation, inaugural flights, christening of airplanes, and airport openings have all been causes for large celebrations. Here is a photo circa 1930 of a terminal dedication with a Western Air Express Fokker F-32 featuring a chorus line dancing on top of the aircraft! Have you ever been to an dedication celebration?",
