We took high-resolution photographs of patterns featured on the seats of a Pacific Southwest Airlinesâ€™ Boeing 727 from the 1970s. The seats were covered in an intricate floral pattern fabric evocative of the popular psychedelic designs of the flower-power counterculture of the late 1960s.Come check out other psychedelic details in our Catch our Style exhibition, on display, pre-security, in our Aviation Museum and Library, located in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.",
