        "body": "During the 1950s, flying on a commercial airliner was often a formal endeavor. Dressed up for the occasion, the Restani family of San Francisco prepares for a flight in a TWA (Trans World Airlines) Lockheed 049 Constellation posing with their TWA flight bags. Many passengers were first-time flyers during this era, when rail and oceanliner services were still heavily used. The new long-range airliners like the Constellation used on extended routes increased the time passengers spent in the cabin during flights. On transcontinental and transoceanic routes, passengers could expect to fly overnight, and be separated from their luggage. Thus, a bag to hold carry-on items became a necessity. Airlines like TWA regularly gave logo-embossed flight bags and amenity kits to passengers for functional purposes and for promotional opportunities.  Our exhibition dedicated to Lockheed, called “Queen of the Skies: The Legacy of the Lockheed Constellation”, is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.
