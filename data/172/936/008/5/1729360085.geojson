        "body": "This Thanksgiving, will you be enjoying an after dinner coffee? Have you ever made coffee from a gas kettle or a Chemex Coffeemaker?  Dr. Peter J. Schlumbohm (1896–1962) utilized scientific laboratory materials to produce some of the simplest and most inventive mid-century designs. Inspired by a chemist’s funnel and beaker, his Chemex “Coffeemaker” combines a single piece of hourglass-shaped #Pyrex® glass, a conical filter of laboratory-grade paper, and a wooden collar fastened with a rawhide tie. A companion to the coffeemaker, the “Gas Kettle” features an ingenious glass-and-cork shuttle valve to control escaping steam. Dr. Schlumbohm held over 300 patents and created an array of inventions, with more than twenty examples in the Museum of Modern Art’s collection in New York.
