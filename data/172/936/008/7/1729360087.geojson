        "body": "San Francisco native Daniel Greenâ€™s artwork conveys an intense and playful fascination with American entertainment and popular culture. Working with wood, cardboard, and paper, Green uses ink to draw figures from television, politics, sports, or history, and then carefully lists dates, titles of shows and songs, cities, and names. The extensive listings crowd the surface in sculptural columns and are seemingly unrelated to his delicately rendered drawings.  See more art by Daniel Green and other artists from Creativity Explored in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisabilty\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
