A crowd of 125,000 people watched from around the Bay Area as the Martin M-130 “China Clipper” lifted off from the waters of San Francisco Bay and strained into the sky threading its way under and over two partially built bridges. It soared through the Golden Gate and slowly disappeared from land as the ship’s crew of seven set course for the Far East and opened the age of regular transpacific oceanic commercial air service. Here, the crowd gathers around the China Clipper before its historic first take off in Alameda on November 22, 1935.",
