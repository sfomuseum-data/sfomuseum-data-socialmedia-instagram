Now American is paying homage to this historic airline by recently painting one of their 737s in the classic AirCal livery.  This timetable from 1985 shows a 737 flying the distinctive AirCal colors. Learn more about AirCal in our “Catch Our Style” exhibition, on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.",
