        "body": "Air California (later renamed AirCal) was founded in 1965 by a group of Orange County businessmen, but after two decades of operation, the airline was acquired by American Airlines. Now American is paying homage to this historic airline by recently painting one of their 737s in the classic AirCal livery.  This timetable from 1985 shows a 737 flying the distinctive AirCal colors. Learn more about AirCal in our “Catch Our Style” exhibition, on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.",
