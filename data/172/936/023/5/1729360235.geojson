An interesting detail to note is at the bottom left hand corner, where there is a Flying Tiger cargo aircraft with an open swing-tail, the turboprop Canadair CL-44D. Based on the Bristol Britannia, CL-44D featured a hinged tail, the first of its kind in a cargo aircraft, which enabled large freight to be loaded straight into the fuselage from the back. The prototype first flew in 1960, and deliveries to the Flying Tiger Line commenced in 1961. #SFOHistory #AvGeek #SFO  San Francisco International Airport (SFO), aerial negative 1963 SFO Museum Collection 2011.032.0866",
