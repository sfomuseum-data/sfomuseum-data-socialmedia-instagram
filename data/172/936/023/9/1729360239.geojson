During this time, he produced numerous sketches and paintings of landscapes, ancient sites, and monuments. Mayer's sketches and paintings were compiled into \"Views in the Ottoman Empire\" in 1803. The ceramics manufacturer Spode copied imagery from \"Views in the Ottoman Empire\" for their Caramanian dinnerware series. The imagery here depicts vestiges of the ancient southern city of Corinth in Greece.",
