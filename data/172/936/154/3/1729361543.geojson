From the 1940s to the present, U.S.-based airlines have effectively used playing cards as a means of promoting various styles of service, aircraft, destinations, and significant events and anniversaries. This deck of playing cards is featured in our Suits that Soar: Airline Playing Cards exhibition, which is display in the aviation museum at SFO until October 18th!",
