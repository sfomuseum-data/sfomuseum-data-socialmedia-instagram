Some airlines, like United, invested entirely in DC-8s, as opposed to expanding their fleets with both the DC-8 and the 707. Here you can see a United Air Lines Douglas DC-8-54AF jet freighter being loaded with a ten-ton capacity freight loader. Fifteen all-freighter DC-8-54AF aircraft were built for United, and first delivered in late January, 1964. On the DC-8-54AF much of the fuselage was windowless.
