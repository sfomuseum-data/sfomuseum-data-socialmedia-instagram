Together, the artwork demonstrates the extraordinary creativity of its makers and confirms the Katzes’ belief in art as an essential and enriching activity. “Celebrating a Vision” will be going to be going up, post-security, in Terminal 3 later this month. #SneakPeek  Art work featured: Untitled by Dan Miller",
