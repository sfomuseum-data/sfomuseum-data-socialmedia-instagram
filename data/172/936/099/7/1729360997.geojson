        "body": "Nature served as a driving force of the Art Nouveau movement, inspiring designers throughout Europe and North America. During the nineteenth century, a multitude of illustrated botanical and biological publications spread knowledge on a variety of flora, fauna, and sea life and allowed students to copy natural imagery. While many Art Nouveau artists took a realistic approach in their interpretations of nature, others created more fanciful designs, with natural imagery appearing in a mysterious, serpentine, dream-like state. See more gorgeous Art Nouveau pieces in “The Allure of Art Nouveau: 1890-1914”, on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal.",
