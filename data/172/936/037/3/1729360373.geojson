Credited with creating the miniskirt and the go-go style “Courrèges boot,” his trim, futuristic youth fashions embraced pant suits and synthetic materials. His 1973 uniform collection for Union de Transport Aériens (UTA) had a skirt or flared trousers option, a fitted sweater, and a short jacket in imitation leather. The pearlescent pink, powder blue, or red outfits came with white vinyl flat boots.  See more uniforms from #UTA in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30 pm. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
