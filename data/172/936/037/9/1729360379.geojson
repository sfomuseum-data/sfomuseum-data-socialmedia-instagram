Three years earlier, San Francisco began leasing land from the Mills Estate to create a temporary, experimental municipal airport. By 1930, climatic studies confirmed that the site was the best possible location for an airport, and San Francisco began a ten-year purchasing program with the Mills Estate to acquire 1,112 acres. Payment was made in annual installments of $105,000 each, the first of which was paid on August 30, 1930. #SFOHistory  Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco, Army Air Corps War Maneuvers air show photograph  1930 SFO Museum Collection 1993.07.17.001 b",
