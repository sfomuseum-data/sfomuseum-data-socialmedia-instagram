Marsh delineates pictorial space by layering multiple two-dimensional planes to create a minimalistic, graphic aesthetic. The work provides a space for the viewer to contemplate their place in the universe and to consider how what is real and what is truth is understood in contemporary experiences.  Vanessa Marsh’s series “Everywhere All At Once” is now on display pre-security in Terminal 3.",
