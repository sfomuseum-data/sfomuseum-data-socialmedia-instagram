Woven in the traditional Aubusson style, these tapestries represent various gardens that the artist remembered from his years living in the Bay Area. Irises, hydrangeas, chrysanthemums and wild dahlias are featured in rich deep shades of the rainbow. More work by Adams, a long-time San Francisco resident, can be seen throughout the city in the stained glass at Grace Cathedral and Temple Emanu-El.",
