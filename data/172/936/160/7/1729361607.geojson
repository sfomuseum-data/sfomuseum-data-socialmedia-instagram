This photo captures Jerry Rice Breaking Jim Brown’s Touchdown Record in 1994 season. Entering the game, Jerry Rice was just one touchdown behind Walter Payton and two behind Jim Brown on the career touchdown list.  Rice went on to put on a one-man-show as he caught seven passes for 169 yards and scored three touchdowns (one of them rushing), passing both Payton and Brown on the career touchdown list. Rice’s final catch of the game was this 38-yard scoring play. #TheNationsGame #mondaynightfootball #JustInTimeForTheSuperBowl  This Mickey Pfleger image is courtesy of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.",
