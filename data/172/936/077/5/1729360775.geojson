        "body": "Master Art Nouveau furniture designer Louis Majorelle (1859–1926) offered clocks in addition to larger furnishings. Born in Nancy, France, Majorelle was admitted to the École de Beaux-Arts in Paris where he studied painting and architecture. Due to the death of his father, he left school and returned to Nancy to take over his father’s furniture firm. At first, Majorelle produced designs inspired by eighteenth-century furniture styles. But during the 1890s, greatly influenced by the work of Emile Gallé, the spearhead of the Art Nouveau movement in the region of Nancy, Majorelle began creating furniture in the new style. At the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle, Majorelle gained international acclaim. His Art Nouveau furniture was celebrated for its outstanding ability to blend the sumptuousness of eighteenth-century craftsmanship with the spirit of the modern era.
