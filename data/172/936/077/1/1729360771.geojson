        "body": "Many of the greatest achievements in Art Nouveau were showcased at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle. One pavilion featured the American dancer Loïe Fuller (1862–1928) performing whirling, undulating dances in which she transformed herself into a flower and butterfly using a myriad of layered textiles. Fuller performed on a glass floor lit from below on a stage surrounded by sheets of mirrored glass. Electric lights, a novelty at the time, shined down on her as she moved around the stage to the music of Chopin and Schubert. Fuller’s dramatic performances inspired a legion of Art Nouveau artists in their designs. Feminine, swirling creatures appeared on everything from fine sculpture to everyday objects, transforming into fantastical creatures—part human, part insect, part botanical specimen. \"The Allure of Art Nouveau\" is located, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ArtNouveauSFO #ArtNouveauSFO  Loïe Fuller transforming into a butterfly during a performance  c. 1901 possibly France Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, Washington, D.C.
