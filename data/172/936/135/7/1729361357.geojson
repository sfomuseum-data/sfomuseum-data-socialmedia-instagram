        "body": "This Sunday is the 80th anniversary of the world’s first scheduled commercial airplane flight across an ocean! A Pan American Airways four-engine transport plane—the twenty-six ton flying boat named China Clipper—lifted off from Alameda, CA, to the Philippine capital of Manila, with four stop along the way, including Hawaii. On that afternoon of November 22, 1935, events unfolded on the waters of San Francisco Bay that would cast the world in a new light.  Our exhibition detailing the entire adventurous endeavor,\"China Clipper\", is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.",
