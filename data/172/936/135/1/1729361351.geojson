A crowd of 125,000 people watched from around the Bay Area as the China Clipper lifted off from the waters of San Francisco Bay and strained into the sky threading its way under and over two partially built bridges. It soared through the Golden Gate and slowly disappeared from land as ship’s crew of seven set course for the Far East and opened the age of regular oceanic commercial air service. Here is an amazing photo of the China Clipper before take off in Alameda on November 22, 1935.",
