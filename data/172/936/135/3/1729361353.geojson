Emphasizing its entry into the jet age, the following year the airline streamlined its thunderbird logo and announced the introduction of new station agent uniforms with light-blue blazers and bright pink stewardess uniforms designed by Saks Fifth Avenue. \"Catch Our Style: California Regional Airlines 1950sâ€“1980s\" features more objects from Pacific Air Lines and other California regional airlines. The exhibition is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm. Do you remembering flying on Pacific Air Lines?",
