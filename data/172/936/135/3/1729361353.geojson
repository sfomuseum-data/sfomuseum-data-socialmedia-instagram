        "body": "In 1965, Pacific Air Lines leased two Boeing 727 jet airliners and placed orders for four more. Emphasizing its entry into the jet age, the following year the airline streamlined its thunderbird logo and announced the introduction of new station agent uniforms with light-blue blazers and bright pink stewardess uniforms designed by Saks Fifth Avenue. \"Catch Our Style: California Regional Airlines 1950sâ€“1980s\" features more objects from Pacific Air Lines and other California regional airlines. The exhibition is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm. Do you remembering flying on Pacific Air Lines?",
