        "body": "Happy St. Patrick’s Day! Looking back at our 2013 exhibition on America’s Cup history, we featured a tenacious Irishman, Sir Thomas Lipton. Sir Thomas Lipton spent a significant portion of his life—and fortune—challenging for America’s Cup in five consecutive contests between 1899 and 1930. A proud son of Ireland, his challenging yachts were all named Shamrock—Shamrock’s I through V. Although he never won the Cup, he won the hearts of the American public through his extraordinary demonstration of class and sportsmanship. http://www.flysfo.com/museum/exhibitions/america%E2%80%99s-cup #ThrowbackThursday #StPatricksDay  Primary object is the clover flag: Private signal flag of Sir Thomas Lipton  n. d. linen, pigments Mystic Seaport  Image in foreground of man in white pants: Sir Thomas Lipton aboard his yacht Erin  1899 photograph by James Burton Mystic Seaport, Rosenfeld Collection",
