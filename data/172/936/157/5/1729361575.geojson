        "body": "For this week's #TravelTuesday, our Curator of Aviation, Dennis, would love to go to Copenhagen, via SAS (Scandinavian Airlines System), for his dream vacation.  In 1954, SAS inaugurated the first transpolar service between California and Copenhagen, Denmark, with stops in Canada and Greenland. This summer, SAS has been offering daily non-stop, transpolar flights between SFO and Copenhagen. The average flight time is only ten hours and forty minutes to be in the Land of the Midnight Sun.  In 1956, SAS contracted with Columbia Records to produce European Holiday to promote its transpolar route to Europe via Copenhagen, Denmark. The record was included with a tourist information packet and featured whimsical songs about countries in Europe conducted by Mitch Miller and sung by Jerry Vale and Jill Corey. This photo is from an advertisement promoting the album and the airline!",
