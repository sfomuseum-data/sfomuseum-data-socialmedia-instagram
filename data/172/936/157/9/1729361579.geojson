Makeup artist Jack Pierce spent several hours transforming Chaney, Jr. into the Wolf Man. The actual transformation scenes took nearly an entire day to film. After Pierce applied one stage of makeup, Chaney, Jr. would be filmed. Then Pierce removed the makeup and applied the next stage. During this time, the film was developed and used as a guide to line Chaney, Jr. up for the next shot. Once all of the sessions were joined together, it appeared as if the Wolf Man transformed in mere seconds.",
