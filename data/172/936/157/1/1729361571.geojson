Benton, a retired UC Berkeley professor, uses a kite-lofted camera to create amazing aerial photographic documentation of the South Bay's salt ponds. Benton’s On Approach allows us to leave our earthly bonds and see the salt ponds from a fresh perspective—a portrait of ecological transformation and resilience.",
