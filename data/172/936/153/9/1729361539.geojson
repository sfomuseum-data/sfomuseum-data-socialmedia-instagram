A leader of the avant-garde, she has been associated with many of the major mid-20th century art movements. This sculpture, called High Heels for Going to Heaven, incorporates shoes which the artist has used as a recurring motif throughout her practice, and polka dots, which she describes as, having “…the form of the sun, which is a symbol of the energy of the whole world and our living life, and also the form of the moon, which is calm. Round, soft, colorful, senseless and unknowing.” High Heels for Going to Heaven is installed in the post-security connector between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.",
