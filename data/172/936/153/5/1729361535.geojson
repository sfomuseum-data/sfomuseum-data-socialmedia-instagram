The J-5 was an exceptional air-cooled radial engine in its time. It was highly valued for its reliability, had a high power-to-weight ratio compared to most other engines of the period, was easy to service, and could operate for long periods without needing added lubrication. Many record-setting long distance flights were made possible in the late 1920s and early '30s because of the ingenuity of this engine's design.",
