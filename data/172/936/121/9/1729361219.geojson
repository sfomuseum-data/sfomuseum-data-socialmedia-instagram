The fair opened again in 1940 from May to September. Treasure Island, located in the middle of the San Francisco Bay, was constructed for the 1939–40 Golden Gate International Exposition. Held in the middle of the San Francisco Bay, the island’s location increased the spectacle of the fair, and people came from around the world to celebrate Pacific trade and the completion of the Golden Gate and San Francisco–Oakland Bay bridges.",
