        "body": "\"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\" has been extended until December! See the exhibition, located post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability Sara Malpass, a master list-maker, reads through books and magazines and catalogs what she absorbs through lists. She also notes her emotions and creates other diaristic entries. Taken together, her lists appear as tributes to her daily encounters with the world.  Malpass’ lists can take the form of spare minimalist ink drawings on blank fields or as essential parts of her maximalist and often overheated abstract paintings. Here, Malpass selects parts of speech from her lists to create glazed ceramic words that are free standing or wall-mounted.  Malpass explains, “I choose words in which I’m interested–words that seem to pop out of the page at me or words that make me feel something . . . when I look back over my lists, I remember those feelings.”",
