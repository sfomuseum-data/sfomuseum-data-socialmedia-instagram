The film starred Boris Karloff as a resurrected pharaoh who becomes obsessed with the modern reincarnation of his deceased beloved. Makeup artist Jack Pierce transformed Karloff into a ravaged mummy during arduous eight-hour makeup sessions. A number of Universal mummy movies followed, beginning with The Mummy’s Hand in 1940.
