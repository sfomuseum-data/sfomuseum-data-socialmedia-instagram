        "body": "John Muir (1838–1914), one of California’s first and most active environmentalists, championed the revolutionary idea that wild spaces should be preserved for generations to enjoy. He published numerous articles and books about the natural wonders of California, such as The Mountains of California (1894) and Picturesque California (1888). His descriptions of glaciers and sequoias exposed the beauty of these natural sites to a mass audience. Come see more of the natural beauty that John Muir loved so much at our exhibition I Love You, California pre-security in the International Terminal. #ILoveYouCA #yosemite125  John Muir  c. 1902 Courtesy of the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, Washington, D.C.
