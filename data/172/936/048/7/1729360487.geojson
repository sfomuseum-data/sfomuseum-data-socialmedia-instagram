        "body": "Blue-and-white transferware reached its peak in production and popularity in the first half of the nineteenth century. Staffordshire potters in central England first developed a successful method for transferring designs onto wares using hand-engraved copperplates as early as the mid-eighteenth century. Previously, potters laboriously applied decoration by hand, which consumed a great deal of time. The process of printing designs on paper and then transferring them directly onto wares transformed the ceramics industry and became a hallmark of the Staffordshire pottery industry.  This exhibition features blue-and-white wares made by Spode and a number of other British potters. Scenes featured on wares range from famous architectural views of India, such as the Taj Mahal, drawn from \"A Picturesque Tour along the Rivers Ganges and Jumna in India\" (1824) to scenes of Turkey and China taken from \"Views in the Ottoman Empire\" (1803) and \"A Picturesque Voyage to India by the Way of China\" (1810). The corresponding prints accompany the ceramic wares. \"From #PrintToPlate: Views of the East on Transferware\" will be on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal starting on Saturday!",
