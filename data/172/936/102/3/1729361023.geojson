Because every child has an individual learning style, teachers implement a broad curriculum, using a variety of techniques to help students learn individually and in cooperative groups to complement each learning style. “Looking Back, Moving Ahead”, a school-wide art project, presents artwork by first- through eighth-grade students. Included in the exhibition is work created in response to investigations of the elements of art, ancient Greece, and the artist Claude Monet. Projects were designed to allow the student’s voice to shine, ensuring success for a wide range of learners. See “Looking Back, Moving Ahead”, pre-security, in Terminal 1.",
