        "body": "Are the '80s back in style now? Because this would be super fashionable today. Created by the legendary French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, the Qantas flight attendant uniforms in 1986 consisted of a dress or blouse with a colorful blue, red, yellow, and brown print on white incorporating the revised kangaroo logo. A smart royal-blue jacket with a burnt-orange collar and sleeve cuffs complemented the uniform. The airlineâ€™s kangaroo logo was affixed on the lapel. A matching scarf with the kangaroo pattern on black completed the ensemble. See this flight attendant uniform and others from the airlines of Australia and New Zealand in our exhibition, Flying Down Under, pre-security in Terminal 1, before it closes next month.",
