This particular DC-3, N136PB, was acquired by Provincetown-Boston Airlines (PBA) in 1974 and operated until the company was bought in the late 1980s; the aircraft was manufactured in 1937 and is currently lovingly maintained and operated by Aerometal International in Aurora, Oregon. N136PB has reportedly more than 90,000 hours flying, the equivalent to more than 10 years in the air!
