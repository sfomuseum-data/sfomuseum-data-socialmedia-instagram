        "body": "The Tushanwan woodshop was led by Bavarian-born Brother Aloysius Beck (1854–1931). He wished to produce a comprehensive study of the Chinese pagoda—the multi-tiered structure with upturned eaves that had long fascinated the West. Some models are accurate reproductions of pagodas at their intended 1:50 scale, while others are more imaginatively rendered. The surfaces of this octagonal structure are decorated with more than one hundred painted panels depicting vines, flowers, pastoral scenes, and a variety of creatures. The Tushanwan Pagodas are on display in the International Terminal until November 2015.",
