        "body": "In 1945, Ada Brown became the founder and first President of the earliest recognized flight attendant union, the Air Line Stewardess Association (ALSA). In 1947, Ada, at the age of 30, was let go from both her job and her position of the ALSA because she decided to marry.  During a time when women could be dismissed from their jobs as flight attendants if they became pregnant, got married, or turned 36, the ALSA fought for women's rights. Women had to adhere to strict regulations to keep their flight attendant positions. The ALSA was the among first instances of women organizing and spearheading for a profession primarily composed of women. The ALSA helped to change the working conditions for female flight attendant professionals. American flight attendants are no longer bound by strict regulations monitoring their martial status, family status, or age. The ALSA exists now as the Association of Flight Attendants â€“ CWA. #WomeninAviation  Photograph of Ada J. Brown 1940 SFO Museum Collection Gift of Georgia Nielsen  2004.044.002",
