        "body": "Photographer Leo vanMunching has been creating a photographic history of the people, places, and architecture of San Francisco since the 1990s. His goal is to document the most pervasive changes of the last two decades. His work focuses on the boom-and-bust cycles in the tech industry and the real estate market—two powerful economic factors rapidly altering the physical and social landscape of the city. See Leo vanMunching’s “San Francisco in Black and White”, post-security, on the departures level of Terminal 2. http://www.flysfo.com/museum/exhibitions/leo-vanmunching-san-francisco-black-and-white",
