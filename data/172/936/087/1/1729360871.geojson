        "body": "Discoveries of ancient Roman glass inspired late nineteenth-century artists to produce similarly lustrous glass.  Founded in 1840 in what is now the Czech Republic, Loetz became the premier Bohemian glass manufacturer by the 1890s, and specialized in iridescent glass.  Active around the same time as Tiffany in New York, the two studios were emulated by other manufacturers in the United States and Europe.  Loetz emphasized glass colors, textures, and patterns—unlike other French glass designers, who favored figural and literal interpretations of the natural world—and a number of ambitious works display an openwork overlay of electroplated silver.
