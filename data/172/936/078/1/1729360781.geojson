The 747 main cabin was wide enough to seat ten abreast and could carry up to 450 passengers. It featured a distinctive pod above the main cabin that formed the flight deck along with a unique first-class lounge. Delta Air Lines chose to divide the pod into a smaller first-class lounge and an ultra-premium-service private penthouse, which the airline advertised as “superb for diplomats or business men, for public figures or families desiring the ultimate in privacy”. Have you ever been in the first-class lounge of a 747?  Delta Air Lines Boeing 747 “Private Penthouse” brochure  c. 1970 SFO Museum Collection Gift of Bill Hough 2006.010.654",
