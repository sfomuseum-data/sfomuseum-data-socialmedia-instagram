        "body": "San Diego-based Pacific Southwest Airlines gained notoriety in the 1970s for form-fitting dresses with dramatically raised hemlines. Cabin interiors were decorated in bright, flowery patterns complementing the pink, red, and apricot colors of the uniform to create what the company promoted as the California Look. This micro-mini dress in polyester was worn over a pair of red mini-shorts. It has a swirl pattern front and teardrop neckline. PSA uniforms of the period included perch hats in red wool felt worn at the side with hat combs, such as this heart-shaped fascinator.  See more fashions from the Bright Seventies in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", on display, pre-security in the Aviation Museum and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
