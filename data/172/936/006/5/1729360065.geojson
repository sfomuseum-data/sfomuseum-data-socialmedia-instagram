        "body": "Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Ramus Forrest (1750–1827) was an amateur artist and East India Company official. Forrest was intrigued by India and hoped to evoke the same sense of excitement in others. The artist emphasized how he drew on site while traveling along the rivers of India “and always while the magic effects of the scenes represented were still impressed on his mental vision.” He felt that the Indian landscape exceeded the scenery of Europe and displayed a “just portrait of the enchanting features of India internally glowing in the brilliant glory of the resplendent Asiatic sun.” Many civil and military officers working for the East Indian Company spent their leisure time making watercolors and sketches of their new environs. Amateur artists often had their work made into aquatints or engravings upon returning to England.
