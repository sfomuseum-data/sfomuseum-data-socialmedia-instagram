        "body": "Emilio Pucci’s outerwear for his layered Braniff Gemini IV uniform vividly expresses his interstellar vision. The zippered overcoat in reversible absinthe and apricot has a stand-away, welted ring collar to meet the bubble space helmet. Worn over a printed velvet hat scarf and formally called a rain dome, the helmet is made of Perspex thermoplastic acrylic and was to protect the wearer’s hairdo. Fragile and with no convenient place to store it on board, it was worn only briefly for greeting passengers at the airplane door and for publicity purposes. #WomenInAviation  See more jet age fashion in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and the Main Hall of the International Terminal.
