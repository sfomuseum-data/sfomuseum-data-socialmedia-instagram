        "body": "Pre-security, in the arrivals level of Terminal 3, we have on display a selection of works from Edward Chavez (1917-2004), a recognized master within the aircraft model-making community.  In 1961, the Nut Tree Restaurant commissioned its first Chavez model after Edwin Power, a pilot and one of the restaurant's owners, had seen Chavez's work in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum. Over the next twenty-seven years, from 1961 to 1988, Chavez built twenty-seven models for the restaurant with occasional assistance from his friend Robert Fogg.  After 75 years of successful operation, the Nut Tree Restaurant closed in 1996. The airfield, donated to Solano County in 1973, continues to operate as the Nut Tree Airport. The models in the Nut Tree Restaurant and Airfield Model Aircraft Collection represent aircraft of historic importance, and in 1997, the majority of the collection was acquired by SFO Museum. http://bit.ly/2giRhXl",
