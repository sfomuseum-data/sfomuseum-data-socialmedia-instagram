The unconventional technique he used in capturing these photos includes using a homemade rigging system and kites. By photographing from heights of up to three hundred feet, Benton brings a much-overlooked part of the San Francisco Bay into sharp focus. Aerial images greatly reduce the sky reflection from the salt-pond surface, thus exposing colors, textures, and traces of the Bayâ€™s previous epochs. On Approach is located in the pre-security connector between Terminals 2 and 3.",
