        "body": "A great promoter of aviation, as well as astronomy and botany, the British author Gertrude Bacon was an experienced balloonist and one of the first women to fly as a passenger in an airplane. In 1904, she rose in an airship and thus became the first woman to fly in a dirigible. Although she never pursued a pilot’s license, she continued to fly as a passenger and later became the first woman to fly in a seaplane. In “How Men Fly,” Bacon offered readers descriptions of the aviators, air meets, and types of flying machines, along with a history of flight and visions of its future.
