        "body": "Knitted, beaded bags required thousands of beads and could take weeks to complete. Beads first had to be strung according to the pattern before knitting could begin. Because an extraordinary amount of time and effort went into making knitted, beaded handbags, they garnered extremely high prices. Transparent, opaque, and iridescent beads in round and bugle or elongated shapes were all employed. Numerous beaded bags were imported from Europe, especially Germany.  French manufacturers first began to make bags from dyed, steel-cut beads during the 1840s. Woven on looms, these shimmering bags were surprisingly heavy due to the weight of the beads. Because these bags were made on looms, the design is the same on both sides, and some bags can be turned inside out. Beads were commonly made in shades of gold, silver, and bronze, and more rarely in pink, white, yellow, and blue. Such luxurious knitted and loom woven bags required elaborate frames and fine silk linings. Many frames were filigreed, enameled, or studded with jewel-like stones. \"Essential Style: Vintage and Antique Purses\" will be on display until the end of the month.
