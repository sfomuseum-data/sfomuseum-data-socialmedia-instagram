Airlines now pursued a broader range of styles as they continued to create distinct identities through the use of company attire.

This bold mini-dress flight attendant uniform for Continental Airlines was issued from 1970 to 1973. Do you remember this uniform?#WomenInAviation #FashionInFlight  See \"Fashion In Flight: An History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
