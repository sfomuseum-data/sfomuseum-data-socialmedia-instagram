        "body": "John Hiltunen of Creative Growth is included in our exhibition \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\". Prior to commencing his focus on making collages in 2006, John Hiltunen created art through rug making, woodwork, and ceramics. His clever juxtapositions, which typically merge animal and human subjects derived from fashion and natural history magazines, are provocative in their humor and yet surprisingly earnest in intention. In Hiltunen’s world of animal-human hybrids, landscapes are turned upside down and runway models have furry ears or whiskers instead of pristine, camera-ready features. Check out this short film by Hiltunen, called “The Painter”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXCyvB6Npq4  See more artwork from Hiltunen and other artists from Creative Growth Art Center, Oakland in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
