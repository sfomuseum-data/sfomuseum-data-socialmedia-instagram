        "body": "By the 1930s, American industrial designers were balancing form and function with technological innovation and new materials. There was no dedicated training at first for industrial designers, and most professionals began as artists, architects, and illustrators. John Vassos (1898â€“1985) started as an advertising designer for Packard Motor Cars, and then worked for RCA, where he introduced the round tuning dial and push-button selector to radio design. For American modernism to be commercially successful, Vassos felt it could not be radical, and he carefully executed designs that softened the harder edges of European modernism with streamlining and sweeping lines.  More Mid-Century design is on display in \"#AModernApproach: Mid-Century Design\" located, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AModernApproach",
