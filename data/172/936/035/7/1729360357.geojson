Her assignments frequently take her to rural locations where her photography serves as the perfect companion. Tarantino considers these journeys as expeditions—opportunities to uncover local history and culture and to discover the hidden treasures she calls “roadside cache.” Roadside America features selections from Tarantino’s travels—discoveries made among the unusual objects and forgotten places along the nation’s rural byways. See \"Roadside America\" by Denise Tarantino on display, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2bR9LfX",
