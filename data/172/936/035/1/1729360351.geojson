        "body": "Continental, which featured an onboard Pink Cloud Buffet Bar, issued this summer uniform from 1967 to 1970. Made in a rose pincord blend, the short sleeve jumper is pleated at the front and has a collarless neckline. The semi-fitted jacket with bracelet sleeves has a brooch depicting a Boeing SST for the insignia. Notably, the white straw beret of synthetic fiber is paired in contrast to the suit instead of a matching color. At the suggestion of actress Audrey Meadows, who was married to company president Robert Six, Continentalâ€™s hostesses received pearls upon their graduation to wear with the uniform. See more uniforms from Continental on display, in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", located, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and the Main Hall of the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight  Continental Airlines hostess uniform  1967 Collection of United Airlines Archive Jacket insignia: Courtesy of Suzanne Cook Necklace: Courtesy of Roselea and Renee Richards L2016.0311.002.01-.03, L2016.0315.001, L20016.0321.001",
