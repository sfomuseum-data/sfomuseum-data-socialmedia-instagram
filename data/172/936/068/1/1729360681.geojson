        "body": "During World War II (1939–45), approximately 300,000 women served in new female branches of the military, both domestically and abroad. The two principal non-combatant military service roles for women included the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) and the Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service (WAVES). Women also served in the Army Nurse Corps, the Navy Nurse Corps, U.S. Marine Corps Women’s Reserve (USMCWR), the U.S. Coast Guard Women’s Reserve (SPARS), and as Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). Others served as volunteers for the American Red Cross. Although the war brought swift and dramatic changes to women’s fashion, even service uniforms required a purse.  Some purses were made with military logos in support of the war effort, such as the “V” for Victory. Other purses were made as a sign of friendship between two countries, such as the purse displayed here with U.S. and British flags. Women also cleverly converted military garb, including simple garrison caps into handheld clutches. Purses might hold treasured letters and telegrams exchanged by loved ones during long periods apart throughout the World War II.",
