        "body": "This is your last week to see \"Catch Our Style\". Our exhibition on California's regional airlines features objects from PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines), Air California, AirCal, Pacific Air Lines, Air West, and Hughes Airwest. In 1969, PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines) began painting smiles on the nose of its aircraft. These two flight attendants pose in front of a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 with the trademark PSA smile. Did you ever fly on PSA?  See more from your favorite California regional airlines in \"Catch Our Style: California Regional Airlines: 1950s -1980s\", on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library, located in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/CatchOurStyle  Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) flight attendants in front of a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 c. 1981 SFO Museum Collection Gift of Carolyn Myers 2010.114.019",
