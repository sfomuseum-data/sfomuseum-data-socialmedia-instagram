In 1907, Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland (1863–1944) invented the first synthetic plastic. Patented as Bakelite, it was lightweight, easily molded, and an excellent electric insulator. Sculptor Isamu Noguchi (1904–88) designed the “Radio Nurse” speaker for Zenith as the world’s first baby monitor with this new Bakelite plastic.
