        "body": "Karen May’s work seeks to recapture an idyllic past. For more than fifty years, May lived with her mother and father, and memories of this time haunt her work. Her paintings are often depictions of the home they shared. Her sculptures are recreations of her family and the town in which she lived. May is also an avid fan of popular music, and frequently incorporates lyrics of hit songs and standards into her work.  See more of May's work in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
