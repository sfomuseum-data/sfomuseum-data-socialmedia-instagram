        "body": "Handbags have been part of the airline uniform since the late 1930s. Traditionally matched with shoes and gloves, some airlines have instead coordinated handbags with the color schemes of their base garments, and issued rules for how and on which side of the body they were to be carried. Airline handbags have followed the practical designs most closely associated with day-to-day career fashion. Front flap messenger shoulder bag styles have been most prevalent and popular, as they can leave the hands free.  See more flight attendant accessories in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight #WomenInAviation #PanAm #crewlife #uniform #fashion  Pan American World Airways stewardesses  1949 SFO Museum Collection Gift of Evelyn R.
