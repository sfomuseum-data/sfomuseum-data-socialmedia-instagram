        "body": "#OnThisDay the Concorde landed at SFO on October 21, 1974. This brief visit was part of a promotional tour to airports around the world. The Concorde was a supersonic transport aircraft that flew primarily commercial transatlantic flights. British Airways and Air France both operated steady commercial service for the Concorde. The inaugural Air France flight from Paris to Washington, DC on May 24, 1976, took 3 hours and 50 minutes and cost $1,654 round trip. Comparatively, a direct flight from Washington to Paris took at least 7 hours. $1,654 in 1976 is the equivalent to almost $7,000 in todayâ€™s currency. The Concorde was in service between 1976 and 2003.",
