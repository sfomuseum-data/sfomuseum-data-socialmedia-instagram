Over the next twenty-seven years, from 1961 to 1988, Chavez built twenty-seven models for the restaurant with occasional assistance from his friend Robert Fogg. The models in the Nut Tree Restaurant and Airfield Model Aircraft Collection represent aircraft of historic importance. The Nut Tree Restaurant and Airfield Model Aircraft Collection is located pre-security in the arrivals level of Terminal 3.",
