        "body": "California-based airlines responded to the space-age looks promoted by other carriers. To project the style of the Golden State, home to a colossal aerospace industry, Oleg Cassini (1913–2006) designed this uniform in 1968 for Air West, a regional carrier headquartered in San Francisco. The two-piece polyester suit matched the colors of the Air West fleet. In the slim-cut jacket, Cassini cleverly combines a “Starfleet Command” look with high collar and jewel button side-flap reminiscent of an early aviator. Worn with knee boots, the vivid color scheme and boomerang insignia at the neck add to the boundless feel of jet travel.  See more uniforms designed by Oleg Cassini in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
