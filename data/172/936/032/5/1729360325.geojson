Like the multi-color “jelly bean” airplanes of Braniff, Air West’s aircraft liveries featured various combinations of two of these colors. Their stewardesses were outfitted in futuristic, slim-cut, high-fashion ensembles created by Oleg Cassini and reminiscent of uniforms worn in the original Star Trek television series, which was popular at the time. An A-line mini-dress was complemented by a double-breasted jacket that fastened on the side with large buttons. Dark brown boots finished off the outfit. The dress and jacket came in the same two-color combinations as the carrier’s aircraft. #WomenInAviation  See more uniforms from the 1960s in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
