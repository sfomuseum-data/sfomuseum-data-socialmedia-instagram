        "body": "This week, our newest exhibition, Early Birds, opens in the Aviation Museum and Library. The exhibition features books published between 1893 and 1914 from the Tony Bill Aviation Library Collection at SFO Museum. These books on aeronautical theory, early human flight, and the development of aviation technology, written by scientists, aviators, inventors, engineers, and university professors, form the basis of aviation knowledge today.  Tony Bill, actor, director, and Academy Award-winning producer, has pursued a lifelong interest in aviation as a pilot and historian, and carefully assembled the collection over many years. The Aviation Museum and Library at SFO is open from 10am - 4:30pm, Sunday through Friday.",
