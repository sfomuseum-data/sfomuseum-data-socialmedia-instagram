        "body": "Anne Morrow Lindbergh, wife of Charles Lindbergh, played a crucial part in aviation history. Together, the Lindberghs embarked on several of aviation's most historic flights. A licensed pilot, radio operator, and navigator, she flew with Charles and often took over for him when he was tired on long flights.  Her other true passion was writing and she authored over two dozens books.  Her bestselling book \"North to the Orient\" chronicled their adventures scouting an air route to Asia for Pan American Airways in 1931. The 7,000-mile journey from New York through Canada, Alaska, Russia, and Japan to China captured the public's imagination and the book went into a third printing by the end of its first week of publication in 1935. It received the year's National Booksellers Award for the most distinguished work of general nonfiction. She went on to write two more bestselling books about their adventures in aviation. #WomenInAviation  Anne Morrow Lindbergh North to the Orient 1935 Harcourt, Brace and Company SFO Museum Collection The Tony Bill Aviation Library Collection 2000.160.1422",
