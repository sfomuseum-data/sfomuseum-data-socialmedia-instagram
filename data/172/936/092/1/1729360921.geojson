One of the companies driving these changes was the Boeing Aircraft Company. Within the span of a lifetime, Boeing went from producing propeller-driven aircraft to modern jet airliners. This United Airlines postcard depicts Boeingâ€™s first modern airliner, the model 247, introduced in 1933, next to the model 777, introduced in 1995. The twin-engine Boeing 247 had a maximum speed of 200 miles per hour, a range of 745 miles, a wingspan of 74 feet, and carried 10 passengers.  In comparison, the 777 has a typical cruising speed of 560 miles per hour, a wingspan of 200 feet, and can carry between 314 and 550 passengers across continents and oceans. #AVGeek  United Airlines Boeing 777 and Boeing 247 Postcard c. 1995 SFO Museum Collection 1998.141.003",
