        "body": "The field of aeronautical engineering led to some of the most profound technological advancements of the 20th century. One of the companies driving these changes was the Boeing Aircraft Company. Within the span of a lifetime, Boeing went from producing propeller-driven aircraft to modern jet airliners. This United Airlines postcard depicts Boeingâ€™s first modern airliner, the model 247, introduced in 1933, next to the model 777, introduced in 1995. The twin-engine Boeing 247 had a maximum speed of 200 miles per hour, a range of 745 miles, a wingspan of 74 feet, and carried 10 passengers.  In comparison, the 777 has a typical cruising speed of 560 miles per hour, a wingspan of 200 feet, and can carry between 314 and 550 passengers across continents and oceans. #AVGeek  United Airlines Boeing 777 and Boeing 247 Postcard c. 1995 SFO Museum Collection 1998.141.003",
