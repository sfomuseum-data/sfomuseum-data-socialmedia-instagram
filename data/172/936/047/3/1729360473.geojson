Before this campaign, commercial airplanes were rarely painted in bright colors.  She was also instrumental in changing airline uniform design; under her direction, Braniff hired Emilio Pucci to design new hostess uniforms, and ushered in a new era of distinct and brilliant color schemes and the use of unique patterns in company uniforms. #MaryWellsLawrence’s radical makeover of Braniff upended the status quo. #EmilioPucci’s designs brought drama and elegance to airborne culture. After Braniff, she founded the successful advertising agency, Wells Rich Greene, and became the first female CEO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. She masterminded notable campaigns such as I ♥ N Y with its now-iconic design by Milton Glaser, Trust the Midas touch, and Flick your Bic.",
