One of the first airlines established in Brazil was the New York, Rio, and Buenos Aires Line, also known as NYRBA Air Lines. Founded by World War I flying ace Colonel Ralph A. O'Neill in 1929, the airline primarily operated Consolidated Commodore flying boats. The following year, NYRBA was acquired by Pan American Airways and changed its name to Panair do Brazil. From 1930 to 1965, Panair do Brazil was one of the largest airlines in Brazil.
