The surveys resulted in a return of over 500 completed questionnaires that the organization has donated to SFO Museum. With the participants’ dates of employment spanning 1944 to 1990, these documents reveal a broad range of career experiences and unique first person accounts from the women and men who provided cabin service for Pan Am from the post-War air travel boom through the jet age.
