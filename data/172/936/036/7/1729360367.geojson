The country seemingly unrolls smoothly, slowly under you. Your flight officers in their own compartment are kept constantly in touch with such mundane affairs as the weather by radio telephone. A directive radio beam marks the airway course; beacon lights point like giant fingers; you drift off to sleep feeling that you're touching shoulders with the stars!\" United Air Lines brochure  c. 1936 SFO Museum Collection 2000.055.017",
