        "body": "Mid-twentieth-century modern design balanced expression with efficiency and utility. Geared towards everyday living, modern design redefined housewares, furniture, and decorative arts as functionally attractive products. The very best were labeled “good design” and exhibited a harmony of planning, materials, and an organic beauty that flowed from the inside out. The form of each object followed its function, with innovative construction methods finished in natural tones and bold colors. Working in the spirit of their time, mid-century designers created items that lent style and comfort to the necessities of modern life. \"#AModernApproach: Mid-Century Design\" is on display, every day, 24 hours a day, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AModernApproachThis",
