        "body": "The earliest purses in our Essential Style exhibition date from the eighteenth century. A multitude of finely embroidered purses in pocketbook or envelope-shaped and drawstring styles were made in the eighteenth century. Miser’s purses, which became commonplace by the late eighteenth century, differed from other types of purses in that they were primarily used to hold coins and currency. Miser’s purses were netted, knitted, and later crocheted in a shape similar to a stocking. Decoration included simple beadwork, embroidery, tassels, or fringe. These purses have a slit through the middle for insertion of coins. Two metal rings slide down to the ends, preventing coins from moving past the ring or being lost. Both men and women used them throughout the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century. See more early purses in our Essential Style exhibition, on display everyday, 24 hours a day, pre-security in the International Terminal. http://ow.ly/XU7Rh  #EssentialPurses  Netted miser’s purse  Late 1700s Courtesy of Paula Novell Higgins L2015.2308.008",
