        "body": "The pottery and cultures of Central and South America inspired many of Marguerite Wildenhainâ€™s ceramics. She sketched figures of indigenous peoples and landscapes that she observed on her trips, then carved and painted these scenes on bowls, vases, tiles, and wall plaques, as well as sculpting figurines. Many of her works portray village life, the Aymara and Quechua Indians of Peru, sheep herds, and other animals of the Andes.  See more South American influenced pottery in \"A Potter's Life: Marguerite Wildenhain at #PondFarm\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 2.  http://bit.ly/PondFarm\"",
