An aviation enthusiast and avid model-maker since childhood, Jim Lund constructed these meticulously detailed model aircraft. Some were constructed from model kits. When a kit was not available, Lund researched plans and crafted the parts from scratch using the “vacuform” process. All of the models are in 1:72 scale. “Early Birds: Selections from the Tony Bill Aviation Library Collection” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.",
