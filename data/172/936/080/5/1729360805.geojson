        "body": "During the late 1930s, airlines began using Bakelite meal service plastic wares because of their light weight and durability. During WWII melamine plastic from Watertown Manufacturing Company was used by the Navy. Following the war, airlines began using melamine dishes, also known as Melmac, and manufactured by numerous plastics companies. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, TWA used mostly butter-yellow melamine dishes. The dishes and cups do not have a makerâ€™s marks, but the tray is marked Air Plastics.",
