Every year, a school theme is selected to offer guidance and inspiration to students and staff. “Destinations” reflects the school’s overarching theme, “Path To . . .” The exhibition and theme embrace the value of open-mindedness and creativity. The artwork on display was created by ninth- through twelfth-grade students and ranges from literal destinations around the world to metaphorical ways of seeing destinations in thoughts and experiences. See \"Destinations\", pre-security, on the arrivals level of Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/1p4IQld",
