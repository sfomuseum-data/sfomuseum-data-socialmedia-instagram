        "body": "Commercial aircraft interiors are one of the most finely tuned, human-made environments. Examples of this can be seen in our exhibition, “Catch our Style: California Regional Airlines 1950s-1980s,” along with a glimpse into the style and fashion of the era. The exhibition features distinctive cabin-crew uniforms and the vibrant aircraft cabin interior and exterior designs from some of the most memprable California regional airlines including PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines), Air California (later AirCal), and Pacific Air Lines (later Air West and Hughes Airwest). The exhibition is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm. Do you have any favorite memories of any of these airlines?",
