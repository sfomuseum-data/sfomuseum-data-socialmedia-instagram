        "body": "San Francisco’s Sunset District, one of the biggest residential neighborhoods in the city, was once mostly sand dunes. As public transportation and the use of automobiles spread, the area was largely developed during the first half of the twentieth century, as a suburb of the city. For six months in 2014 and 2015, photographer Spencer Brown chased street cleaning vehicles along the avenues, capturing relatively treeless scenes devoid of people and cars. The resulting wide-angle shots explore the play of overhead power lines against the sky and the district’s stark, repetitive architecture. \"Sunset, SF\" by @spencerbrownphoto is on display, pre-security on the departures level of Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2gP7JSd",
