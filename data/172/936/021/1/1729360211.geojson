        "body": "Early airline uniforms were worn with shoes that complied with a designated type of footwear, and they were purchased individually. In the 1930s and ‘40s, sensible lace-up oxfords with low block heels provided stable footing in the cabins of the low-flying, unpressurized aircraft that often encountered turbulence. With post-War pressurized aircraft flying above the weather, and new fashion-designer outfits, slip-on shoes became a more stylish accessory. High-heel pumps were issued or designated for purchase by the 1950s, particularly the popular two-tone “spectator” shoe. Custom colored pumps and platform shoes, and modish knee-high boots completed many of the more daring uniform fashions of the 1960s and ‘70s. Such attention to footwear is still practiced by designers like Vivienne Westwood, whose Virgin Atlantic uniform offers heels in three heights. #crewlife #fashion #shoes  See more fashion in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" located, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight  United Air Lines stewardesses  1960s photograph Collection of United Airlines Archive R2016.0307.010",
