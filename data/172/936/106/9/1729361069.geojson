Labels were usually illustrated with the airlineâ€™s logo and often included destinations, route maps, or light and dark backgrounds symbolizing night and day service. During the 1930s, 40s and 50s, the art on luggage labels reached a high level of sophistication, comparable to that found on airline travel posters. Do you own any luggage labels?",
