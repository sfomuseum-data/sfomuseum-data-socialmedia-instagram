Calderon prefers painting on a grand scale, combining saturated hues in broad strokes. He has expanded his subject matter to include different forms of transportation. Elegant, vivid depictions of bicycles and large, birdâ€™s-eye views of trucks flattened out into map-like abstractions dominate this current interest in vehicles.  See more art by Pablo Calderon and other artists from Creativity Explored in \"Celebrating a Vision: ArtAndDisability\", post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
