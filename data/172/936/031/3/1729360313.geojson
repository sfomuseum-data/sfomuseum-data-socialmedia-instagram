        "body": "American designer Roy Halston Frowick (1932–1990), who began designing hats in 1953, was a celebrated figure in fashion and four-time Coty American Fashion Critics' Award winner. The minimalist aesthetic of his 1977 uniform launched Braniff’s New Elegance and Ultra-Touch campaign. Drawing on the success of his Ultrasuede ready-to-wear sportswear lines, Halston used earth tones of light brown, beige, and ivory in polyester suit pieces with tie-belt jacket and H-pattern nylon crepe.  See more Braniff Uniforms in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
