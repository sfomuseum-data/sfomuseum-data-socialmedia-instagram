For instance, the suited businessman is a symbol of mainstream respectability, often contrasted with bold, vividly dressed women. The grandmother figure is a maternal icon of power inspired by the ‚Äútake charge‚Äù matriarchs in her hometown during World War II. The workman‚Äôs glove holds the world in its palm - a statement about the value of work and creativity. All the tiles were handmade. Thanks to @wolfdeasia for the üì∑.",
