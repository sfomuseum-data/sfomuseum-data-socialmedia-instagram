Soon after, this type of seat became standard equipment on most long-distance sleeper-service airliners. By the late 1950s, amenity kits became a common airline giveaway for most long-haul flights, along with sleep masks to block the light from windows overhead lamps, and sleep socks to keep feet warm and insulated from the cold deck of the airplane.
