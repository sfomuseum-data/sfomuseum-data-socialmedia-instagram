Here you can see Cathay Pacific’s first plane, a Douglas C-47, the military designation for the DC-3, nicknamed “Betsy” with the call letters, VR-HDB.  Betsy was found delivering cargo in the Australian outback in the 1980s, lovingly restored to her 1940s livery, and is now on display in the Hong Kong Science Museum.",
