When the Nazis later threatened to close the school if Wildenhain did not resign, she moved with her husband to the Netherlands in 1933. They purchased a pottery studio in the town of Putten, which they named Het Kruikje or The Little Jug. In Holland, Wildenhain created mostly handmade individual pieces with her husband at their shop, in addition to designing industrially produced tea and coffee sets for a Dutch manufactory. Despite her success, impending threats from the Nazi regime led Wildenhain to flee again to the United States in 1940.",
