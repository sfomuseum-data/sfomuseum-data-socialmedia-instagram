        "body": "This summer uniform created for Northwest is a two-piece suit with a trim, collarless short jacket worn over a spring green short-sleeve knit turtleneck and knee-length, A-line skirt. The suit’s lightweight wool fabric with a thin horizontal stripe, has the green, brown, and blue of the woodlands and sky in the airline’s home state of Minnesota. A stylized trapper hat with small visor and contrasting side flaps complements the overall pattern. This uniform was worn from 1967 to 1970, and became known as “the caterpillar” among cabin crews. #FashionFriday #fashion #uniform #crewlife  See more fashion in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight  Northwest Orient Airlines stewardess uniform  1967 Starflite Uniforms Hat by Mae Hanauer SFO Museum Gift of The Museum of Flight Hat: Courtesy of NWA History Centre, Inc., Bloomington, MN Hat insignia: Gift of the Captain John B.
