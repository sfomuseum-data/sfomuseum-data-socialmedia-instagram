        "body": "Tony Pedemonte started at Creative Growth Art Center  making abstract drawings, rarely limited by the paper’s edge. Often incorporating his surroundings, Pedemonte used nearby objects, including other artists’ paints and any other materials within reach. These tendencies eventually resulted in his shift to three-dimensional work and the obsessively wrapped sculptures he now makes exclusively. Pedemonte works with wooden armatures or repurposed items like bicycle wheels, wrapping with one spool of thread after another until the structural frame is nearly concealed. Distinguished by their smooth texture, a monochromatic palette, and geometrically driven configurations, Tony’s sculptures exude a presence that is both tactile and enigmatic.  See more art by Tony Pedemonte and other artists from Creative Growth in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\", on display in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
