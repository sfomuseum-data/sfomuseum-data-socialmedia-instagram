Aquatints, which resemble watercolors, were an affordable alternative to original paintings. This image was taken from the first volume of Oriental Scenery. The structures depicted in the aquatint, built under Firuz Shah Tughlaq (r. 1351â€“88) are no longer extant. Firuz Shah Tughlaq, noted for his passion for building, ruled during the Tughlaq Dynasty (1320-1413), which oversaw the Delhi Sultanate, a Muslim kingdom in and around Delhi, for most of the fourteenth century.",
