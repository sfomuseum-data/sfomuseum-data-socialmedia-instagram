        "body": "Inspired by the flora and fauna of his birthplace in El Salvador, José Nuñez uses assured and controlled paint strokes to delineate different shapes of flowers and other plants. In his figural work, faces made with minimal strokes sit on extremely long, slender legs finished with bare feet in profile. Hints and washes of color are added to punctuate and accent the strength and delicacy of his line. These columnar figures lean and sway to coexist equally in the frame, rarely touching but very close.  See more art by José Nuñez in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\", post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
