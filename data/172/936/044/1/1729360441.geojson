        "body": "Two distinct trends in airline uniforms emerged in the 1970s that embraced the new principles of mix-and-match combinations and color choices. One, the jacket and skirt suit, was traceable to French fashion legend Coco Chanel (1883–1971) who championed daywear for the modern working woman and redefined luxury on a mass scale with a simplicity of style and cut. The other, a cool, comfortable, sporty look of A-line dresses, shifts, and tunics showed resort wear influences. With synthetic fabrics, like polyester, uniforms came in wrinkle resistant, easy care outfits that were all-season for either side of the equator. #WomenInAviation  See more uniforms from the 1960s and ‘70s in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
