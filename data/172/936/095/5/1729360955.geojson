Located at the southernmost point of Texas, near the Mexico–United States border, the Brownsville Municipal Airport served as Pan American Airways’ base of operations for flights to destinations in Mexico by its Mexican subsidiary Compañía Mexicana de Aviación or C.M.A. Two days after the airport opened, on March 10, 1929, Charles Lindbergh piloted a Ford 5-AT Tri-Motor, named Mexico and painted with C.M.A. and Pan American Airways markings, on the first southbound airmail service from Brownsville to Mexico City, via Tampico.
