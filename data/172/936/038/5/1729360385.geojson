        "body": "Incorporating images from his birthplace in the Philippines or his abiding interest in Native American culture, Peter Cordova produces detailed glimpses into aspects of these cultures in his drawings, paintings, and ceramics. Everything is included, from carefully delineated tools and instruments to accurate yet stylized depictions of topography. The completed piece emulates an eyewitness account.  Cordova is also an accomplished ceramicist. The carefully incised marks that adorn his clay forms–often elaborately worked masks or vessels–echo the precise qualities found in his drawings, while the forms themselves add an element of abstraction to his otherwise representational art.  See more art from Peter Cordova in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\" on display, post-security, in the Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
