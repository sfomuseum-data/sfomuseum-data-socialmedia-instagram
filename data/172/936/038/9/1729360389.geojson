        "body": "Airline fashion from the mid-1970s to the present has largely paralleled general trends and popular tastes in women’s daywear and workplace attire. Airlines toned down and refined their looks as air travel became more routine and available to greater numbers in the wide-body jet era. This was a distinct departure from the 1960s and early ‘70s, when flight attendants and fashion were often used for attention-getting promotional purposes and the uniform came to symbolize the liberating feel of the new jet age.  See more uniforms from the 1970s in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. #WomenInAviation http://bit.ly/fashioninflight  Union de Transport Aériens flight attendants in uniforms by André Courrèges  1973 photograph Air France Collection.DR/Air France Museum Collection.DR R2016.0306.012",
