Airlines toned down and refined their looks as air travel became more routine and available to greater numbers in the wide-body jet era. This was a distinct departure from the 1960s and early ‘70s, when flight attendants and fashion were often used for attention-getting promotional purposes and the uniform came to symbolize the liberating feel of the new jet age.  See more uniforms from the 1970s in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal.
