        "body": "The East India Company, an English company that formed in order to trade with China, Southeast Asia, and India, granted Thomas Daniell and his teenage nephew permission to journey to India to work as engravers in late 1784. After traveling more than nine months, including a stopover in China, the Daniells reached Calcutta in early 1786. Thomas Daniell soon placed a notice in the Calcutta Chronicle advertising his intention to publish a set of engraved views of the city by subscription. British patrons purchased the prints for their libraries or framed them for their houses, offices, and clubs. The sale of these works helped fund the Daniells' extensive travels around India to record additional sites. Printing and engraving was difficult for the Daniells to do in India. After producing the series, they focused on drawing and painting, waiting until they returned to England to produce additional aquatints. After settling back in London, \"Oriental Scenery,\" their six-volume series of aquatints, each of which contained twenty-four prints, was published over several years. The seminal work greatly increased Britainâ€™s knowledge of India, while providing British potteries with fascinating new subject matter to feature on dinnerware.  All objects and images are from the collection of Michael Sack. \"From #PrintToPlate: Views of the East on Transferware\" is on display, every day, 24 hours a day, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/PrintToPlate",
