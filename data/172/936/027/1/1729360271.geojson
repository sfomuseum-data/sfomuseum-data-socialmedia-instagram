        "body": "William Scott is a self-taught artist capable of rendering his imagined public and private worlds with remarkable accuracy and meticulous detail. Through a series of drawings and ceramics, he recreates images of the women who attend his Bayview-neighborhood church, an expression of his social longings. With sincere enthusiasm and a highly developed painting and drawing style, Scott questions the hard edge that contemporary city life often creates and offers us a convincing glimpse of an alternative future.  See more art by William Scott in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
