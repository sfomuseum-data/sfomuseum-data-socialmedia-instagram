        "body": "\"In 2005, towards the end of my career as an editorial and corporate #photographer, I began to reflect on the parallel paths my life and #photography had taken. In a conscious effort to look backwards while using the visual awareness developed over the years, I began using a simple plastic toy cameraâ€”the #Holga. The camera had very simple controls, a poor quality lens, and a viewfinder that only approximated what the lens captured. It began to dawn on me that I was choosing to use a camera that was either mocking my age or mirroring my decline. What results from the use of this retrograde technology is both whimsy and nostalgia, mirth and memory. It delights in reminding me of the images of another time, yet frustrates me with its unreliability. With patience, I coax it to occasionally give up a softer, rounder and more satisfying response.
