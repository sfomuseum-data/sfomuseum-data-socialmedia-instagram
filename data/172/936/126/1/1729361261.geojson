San Francisco Airport (SFO) provided 20.53 acres at the mouth of its new man-made seaplane harbor for the Air Station site. In exchange, the federal government dredged and maintained the harbor and its channel to the bay. With a hangar, barracks, and a ramp, the new station was dedicated on February 15, 1941.  The \"United States Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco: Honoring the Guardians of the Golden Gate 75th\" exhibition of photography is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal.
