        "body": "Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco was commissioned November 15, 1940, on the eve of World War II.  San Francisco Airport (SFO) provided 20.53 acres at the mouth of its new man-made seaplane harbor for the Air Station site. In exchange, the federal government dredged and maintained the harbor and its channel to the bay. With a hangar, barracks, and a ramp, the new station was dedicated on February 15, 1941.  The \"United States Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco: Honoring the Guardians of the Golden Gate 75th\" exhibition of photography is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.
