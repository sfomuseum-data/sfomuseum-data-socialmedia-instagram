Though it never leaves the ground, the machine can simulate every emergency which might be encountered in actual flight. This view shows (left to right), the head instrument instructor, captain, flight engineer and first officer busy on a training 'flight'. The circular device at left is an area map on which the simulator’s flight track is traced by a moving arm.”",
