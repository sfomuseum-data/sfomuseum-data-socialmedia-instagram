Taking inspiration from Arts and Crafts, Art Deco, and Art Nouveau designs, these bags were made of genuine English and Spanish steerhide, cowhide, and calf leather, and were made in hundreds of styles. Skilled artisans typically made these bags in cottage industry settings, and as their popularity increased, they were sold by numerous companies.",
