        "body": "These four sculptures were created from translucent white silicone coated fiberglass material stretched over a metal frame and inserted within the truss structure of the skylights, 70 feet above the floor. The design of the four 180 x 30-foot sculptures was inspired by the construction of the Wright brothersâ€™ first airplane, and also recalls dirigibles, or and boats. The sculptures are functional in that they diffuse direct sunlight from the skylights, reflect light up onto the opaque surface of the roof, and project a dappled play of light into the space. \"Four Sculptural Light Reflectors\" by James Carpenter can be found pre-security, on the departures level of the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/2a7a6JY",
