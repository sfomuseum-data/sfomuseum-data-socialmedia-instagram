The two men in this photograph, one identified as aerial photographer and aviation engineer, Stanley H. Page, used this camera to take photographs above San Francisco circa 1920. #SFHistory  Cameras similar to this were also used in early aerial archeology in Europe, North America, and the Middle East. Our exhibition exploring aerial archeology \"#TerraCognito: Published Works of Discovery by Aerial Explorers\" is now on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library located in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily, from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/TerraCognito",
