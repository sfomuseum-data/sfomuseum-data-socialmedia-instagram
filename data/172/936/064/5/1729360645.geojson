        "body": "Don’t miss \"United States Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco: Honoring the Guardians of the Golden Gate 75th\". This photography exhibition celebrates our local Coast Guard chapter, based right here at SFO. For seventy-five years, the dedicated men and women of U.S. Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco have saved souls, aided navigation, enforced federal and international law, and protected living marine resources on the inshore and offshore waters along three hundred miles of California coastline. As the “Guardians of the Golden Gate,” these dedicated officers and enlisted personnel are the ever-vigilant eyes in the sky. Their command and capabilities in aerial search and rescue and homeland security personify the Coast Guard motto “Semper Paratus” (Always Ready). See this exhibition, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm except holidays. http://bit.ly/1XRNG3e",
