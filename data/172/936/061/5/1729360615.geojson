        "body": "Marguerite Wildenhain (1896–1985) enjoyed a prodigious sixty-year career as a master potter. Born Marguerite Friedlaender in France, she was of English, German, and Jewish heritage and lived in both England and Germany as a child. During her lifetime, she survived the hardships of World War I and studied with the famed Bauhaus school in Germany, becoming the first woman to achieve master potter status in Germany. To escape persecution as World War II gripped Europe, she immigrated to the United States and settled in California. In Sonoma County, California, she opened the legendary Pond Farm pottery school in addition to enjoying a successful career in clay, winning numerous awards for her work.
