The Bride of Frankenstein opens with author Mary Shelley, played by Elsa Lanchester (1901–86), who also plays the Bride of Frankenstein in the film, explaining that Frankenstein’s Monster never really died at the end of her story. In this sequel, Pretorius, Dr. Frankenstein's apprentice, persuades the Monster to abduct Dr. Frankenstein’s wife in order to coerce Frankenstein into helping them to create a mate for the Monster. The mate they create comes to life, but the Monster’s bride is utterly terrified of her intended spouse. Heartbroken, the Monster pulls a lever in the lab causing the tower to explode. The Monster, his estranged bride, and Pretorius are killed, while Dr. Frankenstein and his wife manage to escape. Classic Monsters: The Kirk Hammett Collection is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2 until December. #KirksMonsters #KirkHammett @KirkHammett #HappyHalloween  Bride of Frankenstein painting  c. 1974  Artist: Basil Gogos  R2014.3901.139",
