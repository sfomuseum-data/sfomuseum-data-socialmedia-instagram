        "body": "Trained in architecture at Yale University and in Rome, George Nelson (1908–86) melded European modernism with American industrial design in furniture, household items, and modular office components. As Herman Miller’s Design Director, he created the “Slat Bench,” “Case Series,” and “Coconut Chair,” authored catalogs, directed brand identity, and hired new designers including Alexander Girard, Isamu Noguchi, and Charles Eames. Nelson’s clocks for the Howard Miller Company incorporated standard movements into artistic and whimsical housings of industrial materials such as wood, aluminum, brass, and plastic.
