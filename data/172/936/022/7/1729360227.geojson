        "body": "As you have gotten off your international flight at SFO have you noticed the textured walls as you walk to border patrol? It is \"You Were in Heaven\" by Ann Preston.  A ceiling dome, installed at one end of the corridor and lit through blue gels, it is inspired by early creation myths that describe the sky as originating from ice crystals. On the floor below the dome are bronze and terrazzo medallions. As passengers pass through the dome and walk along the corridor wall, they encounter five 60-foot long curved niches. In these niches, groups of cast plaster tiles with forms derived from the theories of English mathematician Roger Penrose, are fitted together to create shapes that resemble clouds. The artist created these complex forms using only two unique shapes of tiles. #SFAC #SFO #AirportArt #AnnPreston  See \"You Were in Heaven\" by Ann Preston, post security, in Boarding Area A in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/2dHu9Ao",
