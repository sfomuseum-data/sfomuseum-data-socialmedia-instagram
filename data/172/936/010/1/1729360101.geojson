The cropped, tuxedo-style jacket has the wide lapels, padded shoulders, and narrow waist of Saint Laurent’s 1980s power-suit designs for his Rive Gauche label. Terracotta collar and cuff trim project a regimental formality, while the colorful Qantas flying kangaroo pattern of the cotton-poly skirt and blouse adds a festive air.  See more 80s fashion in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" on display, pre-security in the Aviation Museum and Library and the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10 AM to 4:30PM, excluding holidays. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
