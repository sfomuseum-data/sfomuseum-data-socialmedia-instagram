        "body": "Often sporting perfectly monochrome outfits complete with a matching flashlight necklace, Monica Valentine is enamored with color. Based on her artwork, it comes as a surprise to most that she is completely blind and uses prosthetic eyes. Valentine is incredibly adept with her hands, creating works that are as tactile as they are visually rich. She speedily threads sequins and beads onto thin pins and covers the entire surface of foam shapes. These shapes vary between spheres, cubes, and cones, but are always so densely covered that they sparkle like crown jewels of a lost disco civilization. She considers these objects decorative and celebratory, and she revels in othersâ€™ visual delight over them.  See more art by Monica Valentine and other artists from Creativity Explored in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
