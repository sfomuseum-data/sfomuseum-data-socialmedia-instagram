        "body": "We must learn from the past and dedicate ourselves as a nation to renewing the spirit of equality and our love of freedom.” President Bill Clinton, 1993, in an official presidential letter to Japanese Americans interned during World War II.  In 1943, renowned photographer Ansel Adams (1902–84), famous for his western landscapes, documented the daily life of Japanese Americans interned at the Manzanar War Relocation Center during World War II. Fear of espionage, coupled with escalating racial prejudice after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to sign Executive Order 9066 in 1942 forcing more than 110,000 Japanese Americans to leave their homes in California, parts of Arizona, Washington, and Oregon.  In 1988, Congress implemented the Civil Liberties Act, apologizing on behalf of the nation for the “grave injustice” Japanese Americans experienced during the war, and offering restitution to surviving internees.  See \"Manzanar War Relocation Center\" by #AnselAdams, on display, pre-security, on the Departures Level of Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/2deWdM0",
