        "body": "Lincoln Beachey was born in San Francisco in 1887. He had an early fascination with aerial experimentation and was soon an accomplished professional aviator and aerial stunt performer. He was hired to perform exhibition flying for the 1915 the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, held in San Francisco between February 20 and December 4.  Early aviation was as risky as it was profitable, with tens of thousands of people turning up to watch “The Man Who Owned the Sky.” Lincoln Beachey tragically lost control of his plane during a fatal stunt over the San Francisco Bay on March 14, just 11 days after his 28th birthday.",
