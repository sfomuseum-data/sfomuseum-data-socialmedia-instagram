        "body": "One of our preparators, Nick, would love to go to New Zealand for his dream holiday. Pan American World Airways flew their first scheduled flight to New Zealand in 1940. The flight did not carry any paying passengers, only airmail and CAA and Pan American employees. The flight took 4 1/2 days, a quarter of the time it took to sail to New Zealand.  This month marks the 75th anniversary of Pan American’s Inaugural Passenger flight from SF to New Zealand. On September 11, 1940, Pan American’s American Clipper took off from San Francisco, and stopped in Los Angeles, Honolulu, Canton Island, and Noumea, New Caledonia before finally landing in New Zealand.",
