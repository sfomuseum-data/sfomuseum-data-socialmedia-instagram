In 1910, Glacier National Park contained more than 150 glaciers; today only twenty-five remain. Van Coller documented how rapidly the glaciers were retreating during the summers between 2012–14. Van Coller’s photographic goal was to situate the viewer within the terrain. See Ian van Coller’s The Last Glacier located post-security in Terminal 3.",
