        "body": "The development of aviation technology has changed the world. This Mexicana Airlines poster not only displays the progression of their fleet but also the progression of aviation technology over sixty years. Six models of aircraft are illustrated chronologically from 1921 to 1981: the “1921 Lincoln Standard”, “1929 Ford Tri-Motor”, “1938 Douglas DC-3”, “1960 de Havilland Comet 4C”, “1965 Boeing 727”, and “1981 Douglas DC-10-15”. This poster also is a great display of the size of aircraft. The change in airplane sizes is evident: the 1921 Lincoln Standard had a wing span of 44 ft 7 in and a maximum speed of 92 miles per hour. Sixty years later, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-15 had a wing span of 155 ft 4 in and a maximum speed of 610 mph.
