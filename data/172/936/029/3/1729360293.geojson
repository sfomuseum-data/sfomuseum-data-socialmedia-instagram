The mausoleum was built in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, for emperor Akbar (1542–1605). The impressive main gateway is made of red sandstone and contains intricate inlay patterns of white marble and colored stone. Under Akbar’s reign, Mughal architecture flourished, combining elements of Persian, Islamic, and Hindu designs.  All objects are from the collection of Michael Sack.
