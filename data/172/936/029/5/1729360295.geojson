        "body": "Billy White is a natural storyteller. He weaves tales throughout the scenes he creates in his artwork, explaining that “stories form in my head while I'm drawing.” White’s subjects range from casual encounters with people he meets to memories of his childhood growing up in Richmond, California; from film and television celebrities to imagined characters, such as “Count Dracula, the Wrestler.” He is especially interested in the work of Vincent van Gogh, and sees van Gogh’s missing ear as a disability to be overcome, much like White’s life efforts.  See more artwork by Billy White and other artists from NIAD Art Center in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
