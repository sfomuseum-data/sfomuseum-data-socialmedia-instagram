Art Nouveau manufacturers offered a variety of metalwork desk items, particularly inkwells cast in bronze. Though produced in fairly large numbers, desk items were fabricated with great care. Many of these pieces were produced in gilded bronze. Gilding entails applying fine gold leaf or powder to bronze, which leaves the surface with a thin coating of gold. “The Allure of Art Nouveau” is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ArtNouveauSFO  #ArtNouveauSFO  Desk set  c. 1900 Hans Müller (1873–1937) Austria gilt bronze, marble Courtesy of Chuck Morgenstern, Woodchuck Antiques, San Francisco L2015.2501.004.01-.04",
