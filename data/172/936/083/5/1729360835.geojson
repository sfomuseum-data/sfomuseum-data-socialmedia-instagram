        "body": "Leather is one of the oldest materials used by man and has long been a valued material in the production of handbags. Exotic leather skins such as snake, crocodile, alligator, ostrich, lizard, and armadillo are not only durable but display striking textures. Victorian and Edwardian era handbags and clutches made from alligator leather emphasize the natural texture and color of the skins, often featuring head and back horns in a range of browns and tans. Some of these antique purses even have heads and claws sewn onto the bags, and coin purses were commonly offered in the form of clawed feet. The popularity of exotic animal skins continued in later decades: In 1953, Sears catalogs offered alligator bags with or without the head and the claws for the price of $16.98 for either style.",
