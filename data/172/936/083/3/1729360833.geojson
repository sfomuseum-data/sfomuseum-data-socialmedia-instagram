        "body": "John Martin creates drawings from his memories of time spent with his family on their Arkansas farm. Martin’s signature imagery makes his work instantly recognizable—trucks, snakes, pocket knives, cell phones, and the occasional item from discarded valuables he finds on the streets of Oakland. Through his extraordinary imagination, Martin transforms everyday objects into talismans of sharp-toothed animals and goofy characters working at @creativegrowth.  See more of John Martin’s art in “Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability”, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
