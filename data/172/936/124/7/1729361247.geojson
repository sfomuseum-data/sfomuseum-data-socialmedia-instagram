Tittle, and fullback John Henry Johnson. All four are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the only complete backfield from one team so honored.

His photo-essay, “From Kezar to Candlestick”, documenting the 49ers home games, is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. Photo: © Frank Rippon",
