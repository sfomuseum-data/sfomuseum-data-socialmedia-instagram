        "body": "In New York, the most prominent Art Nouveau artist was Louis Comfort Tiffany. Tiffany took the science of glassmaking and elevated it to an art form by employing a variety of novel techniques. Many of his glass creations appear to have an internal glow. As with his peers, he drew inspiration for the shapes of his vessels from nature, the arts of Japan, and borrowed from antiquity. Ancient Roman, Syrian, and Egyptian glass, as well as sixteenth-century Venetian glass, influenced his creations. The renowned Parisian gallery owner Siegfried Bing promoted his work in Paris and throughout Europe, where it was highly esteemed by artists and patrons alike.",
