Just before World War II, in May of 1939, Pan American established the first regular air service across the Atlantic using airplanes. Four years earlier, the airline had established the first regular air service across the Pacific. After the war, Pan American produced beautiful travel posters promoting these transoceanic services. Pan Amâ€™s Stratocruisers would help to define luxury air travel during the era.
