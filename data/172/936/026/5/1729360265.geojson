While she worked on converting the barn, Wildenhain camped outside under walnut trees and cooked on a small sheepherder-stove. Throughout this challenging period, Wildenhain recalled feeling “so elated at having built-up whatever there was practically with my own hands that weeks and months passed for me in real enthusiasm and hope.” Today, Pond Farm is listed in the National Register of Historic Places - NPS.",
