        "body": "Christian #Dior’s lasting influence on women’s #fashion began in 1947 with the debut of his Corolle collection in Paris. An international sensation, his “new look” heralded a return to femininity and romance. By 1960, as domestic and international airlines overtook rail and ocean liner travel, the economy of jet service in cost and time dramatically raised airline numbers. In this newly mobile society, the stewardess emerged as a powerful symbol of the glamour and worldly sophistication promised by an increasingly competitive airline industry, and high fashion took to the air. It is during this period that this unique career type, and the associated attire, began to achieve iconic status.  See more flight attendant uniforms in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline #Uniform #Design\", on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. #WomenInAviation #CrewLife http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
