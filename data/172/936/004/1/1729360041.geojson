        "body": "Many airline uniforms projected a cosmic vibe as theatrical marketing campaigns changed the look of flight fashion. Mary Wells Lawrenceâ€™s radical makeover of Braniff upended the status quo, and designers like Emilio Pucci and Pierre Cardin brought drama and elegance to an airborne culture. New shapes and silhouettes abruptly appeared and hats turned into more helmet-like forms of headwear.  See more jet age fashion in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm, excluding holidays. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
