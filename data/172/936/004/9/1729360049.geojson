        "body": "Eight years ago, artist Joseph Finkleman began photographing high-rise buildings with a digital camera, rather than a traditional film camera. Skyscrapers fascinate himâ€”their metal and glass facades can range in appearance from flat to sculptural, solid to immaterial, depending on the viewing conditions. Finkleman is awestruck by the design, engineering physics, and resources involved in making these buildings, and ponders the sheer power of their symbolic representation. The glass cladding emits different parts of the color spectrum so that individual buildings display varied hues. Finkleman captures these spectacles of color, pattern, and reflection through his lens. By emphasizing details on the curtain wall, he draws the viewer in to the transcendent beauty of these towering monuments.
