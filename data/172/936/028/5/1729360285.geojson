While confined in a Japanese American internment camp during the Second World War, Asawa learned to draw from Tom Okamoto, a Disney animator also interned at the camp. After a trip to Mexico, she was inspired by looped wire #basketry used to store produce and eggs in the marketplace. Asawa combined traditional Mexican wire looping with her line drawing designs and wove complex and flowing three-dimensional hanging mobiles, similar in construction to the egg #basket pictured here.  See more art by #RuthAsawa in \"#AModernApproach: #MidCentury #Design\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AModernApproach  Basket  1950 Ruth Asawa (1926–2013) San Francisco copper wire Courtesy of The Modern i Shop L2016.1501.063",
