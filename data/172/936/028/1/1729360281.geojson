        "body": "New York-based fashion designer #StanHerman (b. 1932) counts several airlines among a long list of large companies for which he has created uniforms. Credited as one of the first to introduce pant suits for women, this 1974 TWA uniform in lightweight wool was part of a popular mix-and-match set worn until 1977. Casually sophisticated, the pinstripe flared pants and a rib-knit turtleneck top were worn with the belted safari-style polyester jacket.  See more TWA uniforms in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
