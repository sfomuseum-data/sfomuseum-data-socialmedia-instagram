        "body": "David Levinthal was born in 1949 in San Francisco and grew up in the Bay Area. Fond childhood memories of air travel with his parents in the 1950s inspired this collection of photographs images, presented here on the twentieth anniversary of its original exhibition by SFO Museum in 1996.  Using vintage toys from the collection of the San Francisco Airport Commission Aviation Library and Louis A. Turpen Aviation Museum, Levinthal created scenes that evoke memories of air travel. Levinthal recalls a time when San Francisco International Airport consisted of one terminal building and propliners dominated the runwaysâ€”a period when air travel was a unique and special event. Women wore gloves, men wore hats, and everyone dressed their best for the nine-hour flight from San Francisco to New York City. \"Airport\" by #DavidLevinthal is on display, post-security, in Terminal 1.",
