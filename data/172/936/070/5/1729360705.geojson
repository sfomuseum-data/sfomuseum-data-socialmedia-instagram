        "body": "Hangar No. 1 at Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco was completed by September 21, 1927. It was erected with a steel frame that fastened with nuts and bolts—instead of rivets—to allow for later disassembly and relocation, as Mills Field was still a temporary location for the airport. In January 1928, rates were set with the following fees: $1 for landing and take off per day, excluding permanently based operators, military, and non commercial flights; $35 hangar rental per month for Class “A” Sport Commercial Type airplanes; $1.50 for transient overnight hangar rental; or 50 cents for field rental. #ThrowbackThursday #SFOHistory  Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco, Hangar No. 1 1928 SFO Museum Collection 2011.032.0069",
