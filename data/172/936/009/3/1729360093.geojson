        "body": "Japanese designer Hanae Mori (b. 1926) started her fashion career in Tokyo for the film industry in the 1950s and began presenting haute couture in Paris in 1977. This “fifth generation” JAL uniform was designed in 1970 for the airline’s first wide-body jet service. The dark blue polyester knit mini-dress was a striking departure from JAL’s earlier uniforms and is accessorized with a semi-rigid bumper brim hat, and a two-tone silk scarf.  See more jet age fashion in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm, excluding holidays. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight  Japan Air Lines stewardesses in uniforms by Hanae Mori  1970 photograph Courtesy of Japan Airlines R20016.0326.001",
