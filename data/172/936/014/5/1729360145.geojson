The de Havilland Comet was the first commercial jetliner to be introduced. BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation) began service in 1952. The De Havilland DH-106 Comet 4 was introduced in 1958 and was the last and most successful version of the Comet. Seventy-seven were built, consisting of the medium-range Comet 4B and the medium-to-long-range Comet 4C.  Pictured here is a de Havilland DH-106 Comet 4B in Dan Air livery.",
