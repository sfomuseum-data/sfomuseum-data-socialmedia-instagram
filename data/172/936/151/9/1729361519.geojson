Led by Bavarian-born Brother Aloysius Beck (1854–1931), the workshop was part of a Jesuit-run vocational arts and crafts training school for orphaned boys who exhibited particular artistic talent. All  seventy-nine hand-carved pagodas are all based on real life structures located throughout China. The Tushanwan Pagodas are on display pre-security in the International Terminal until November 2015.",
