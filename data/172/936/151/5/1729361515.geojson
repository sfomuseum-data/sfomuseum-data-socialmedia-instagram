The giant sea bass, the largest bony fish that inhabits the California coast and its offshore islands, lives in shallow, rocky reefs. A native of the North Pacific Ocean, the giant sea bass may grow up to seven-feet long and weigh as much as 750 pounds. Commercial fishing for giant sea bass began in southern California around 1870; sport fishing commenced around 1895. By the 1950s, over fishing of the giant sea bass caused their population to drastically decline. In 1982, the state banned commercial and sport fishing. As a result, the giant sea bass population continues to make a slow recovery.  Giant sea bass skull (Stereolepis gigas)  Collection of the @calacademy  CAS 214927 L2015.0706.001",
