        "body": "Pan American’s transpacific flight service would not have been possible without the additional support and expert skills of the airline technicians and construction engineers who built the island bases. The 15,000-ton steamer ship North Haven was chartered to build bases at Honolulu, Midway, Wake, Guam, and Manila. The ship sailed from San Francisco on March 27, 1935; its cargo included two pre-fabricated villages, five air bases, and fifty-foot timbers to build radio towers. A second North Haven expedition in January 1936 built hotels on the islands for overnight passenger accommodations and delivered station managers, hotel superintendents, and other Pan American personnel who took up residence on the new mid-Pacific bases. \"China Clipper” is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.",
