        "body": "The Loughead brothers, Allen and Malcolm, were born in what is now called Fremont in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1800s. They moved to Santa Barbara, CA as children, but returned to San Francisco and started the Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company in 1912. After participating in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915, they changed the name of their company to the Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company and moved back to Santa Barbara. By 1926, after changing his last name to Lockheed (the phonetic spelling of Loughead) Allen formed the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. In 1932, a group of investors bought it and formed the Lockheed Aircraft Company.  Our exhibition dedicated to Lockheed, called “Queen of the Skies: The Legacy of the Lockheed Constellation”, is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.",
