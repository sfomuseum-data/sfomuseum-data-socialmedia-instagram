Each class receives weekly art lessons to learn new skills for expression through a variety of mediums and techniques. The focus of this project was to cultivate an appreciation for the intricacy of flowers through observation from an artistic perspective. Through this art project, students were able to study different types of flowers and discover the beauty in the tiniest of patterns as they developed their artistic skills and translated their observations into unique works of art.",
