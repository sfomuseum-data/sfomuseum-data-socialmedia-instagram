With a cool, resort-wear look, the simple polyester dress with loose rolled collar came in solid red, white, or blue, and was matched with the tri-color vinyl belt with interlocking clasp and checkered scarf.  See more uniforms from the 1960s and 70s in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and in the Main Hall of the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
