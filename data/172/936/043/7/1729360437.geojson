        "body": "Marlon Mullen bases his paintings on found photographic images, mostly from lifestyle magazines, newspapers, and contemporary art periodicals, which the artist uses as inspiration for his work. In the process of developing a painting, Mullen’s original magazine pages become obscured or abstracted as the image is reduced to a graphic schema of interlocking colors and forms. “His advertency to the nuance of shape is idiomatic and completely fearless,” explains Manhattan’s JTT Gallery Director Jasmin Tsou, “and yet these are not aggressive works, but rather, beautiful and buoyant compositions. His is a truly unique vision that is as equally abstract as it is emotive.” See more art by Marlon Mullen and other artists from the NIAD Art Center in \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
