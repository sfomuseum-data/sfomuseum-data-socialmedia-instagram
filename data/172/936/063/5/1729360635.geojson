        "body": "The Western World has long been inspired by Chinese and Japanese arts. By the eighteenth century, large quantities of porcelain, silk, and lacquerware were imported from China and Japan. As a result, many European designers and craftsmen began emulating Asian designs and creating their own imaginative interpretations. In the mid-nineteenth century, after living in isolation for centuries, Japan opened its doors to the West and increased trading. Worldâ€™s Fairs in Europe and the United States began to showcase Japanese arts to a mass audience. Japanese artifacts readily appeared in exhibitions, import shops, and art collections. As in the past, artists and designers incorporated Japanese motifs and designs into their work. This long-held enchantment with the East found its way into beaded and embroidered bag designs. Makers embellished purses with Japanese and Chinese scenes, and motifs from dragons to Chinese emperors.",
