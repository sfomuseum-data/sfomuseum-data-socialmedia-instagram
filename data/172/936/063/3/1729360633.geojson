        "body": "The malleability and brilliance of silver lent itself to the style of Art Nouveau. Silversmiths throughout Europe and the United States offered intriguing designs in sterling. Large firms offered silver-plated wares at more commercially viable prices. Württembergische Metallwarenfabrik of Germany, commonly referred to as WMF, was a major producer of silver-plated items in the Art Nouveau style, known as Jugendstil in Germany. Famous for its patented process of electroplating flatware, WMF released a catalog devoted to the new style in 1906 entitled, “Art Nouveau Domestic Metalwork.” The firm employed over six thousand workers in Austrian, German, and Polish factories. The silver-and-green glass decanters on view are excellent examples of WMF’s prized work.",
