        "body": "Western Air Lines introduced Wally Bird as its mascot in 1955. His name derived from the phrase “Western Air Lines Loves You.” The plump yellow bird with prominent beak reclined against the tail fin of one of Western’s passenger planes while hoisting a glass of champagne and toasting the luxurious treatment provided by Western Air Lines. Wally’s catchphrase “It’s the Ooonly way to fly!” became ingrained in popular culture.
