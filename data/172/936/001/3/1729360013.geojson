        "body": "Lebanese designer Papou Lahoud began her fashion career in 1965. Her creations include theater costume, evening wear, and wedding gowns. She began designing uniforms for Alia, now called Royal Jordanian, in 1973. Italian-tailored in polyester and cotton, this uniform combines the company colors in a jacket worn over a smart one-piece contrasting shirt-dress with tie belt. The felt kepi cap has a rayon twist chin-strap, and the vivid pattern of the scarf unifies the look. #WomenInAviation  See more 1970s fashion in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm, excluding holidays. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
