        "body": "By the late 1950s, popular recording artists were infusing their records with the appeal of chic international air-travel on modern airliners. Frank Sinatra’s Come Fly with Me, released in 1958, featured cover art by Marvin Schwartz of a sleek TWA (Trans World Airlines) Lockheed 1649 Starliner on the runway. In the title song, the singer encouraged listeners to fly with him to Bombay, Peru, Acapulco Bay, and a host of other distant, exotic lands.  See this record on display in \"Queen of the Skies: The Legacy of the Lockheed Constellation\". This exhibition is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is located in the International Terminal and open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/TWASkyliner #‎TWASkyliner  Come Fly with Me, Frank Sinatra with Billy May and his orchestra TWA (Trans World Airline), Frank Sinatra, phonograph record 1958 SFO Museum Collection 2009.161.010",
