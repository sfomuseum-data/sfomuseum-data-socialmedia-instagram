        "body": "By 1939, with the introduction of service to Europe via Portugal, Pan American Airways had become a truly global airline. In order to promote its new status, the carrier eventually added “World” to its name and changed its logo from a globe showing North and South America to one displaying the entire western hemisphere. In the late 1940s, the airline introduced the revolutionary Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, and with it, a pack of playing cards featuring the new airliner and photographs of the numerous worldwide destinations the airline served. This is your last week to catch Suits That Soar in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from 10am to 4:30pm, Sunday through Friday.",
