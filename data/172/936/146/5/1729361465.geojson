        "body": "As its name implies, United Airlines originated from a merger of several early air transport companies that began operating more than 75 years ago. The main companies were Boeing Air Transport, National Air Transport, Pacific Air Transport, and Varney Air Lines. Boeing and National were strictly mail carriers until 1927 when they joined to start planning coast-to-coast passenger service. By 1931, all four carriers were operating as subsidiaries of the newly incorporated United Airlines. United hired nurses who became the industry's first female flight attendants in 1930. One of Unitedâ€™s main hubs is right here at SFO.",
