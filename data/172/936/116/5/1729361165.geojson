Atlantic Clipper will carry Pan American passengers across the Atlantic is shown here in cross section.“ The Boeing 314 with the registration number NC 18601 shown in this rendering was actually given to the Honolulu Clipper, which was delivered to the airline on January 27, 1939, and placed into service in the Pacific shortly after. The Atlantic Clipper’s registration number was NC 18604 and delivered to Pan American on March 20, 1939. The Dixie Clipper, registration number NC18605, inaugurated the world’s first regularly-scheduled and sustained transatlantic passenger service on June 29, 1939.
