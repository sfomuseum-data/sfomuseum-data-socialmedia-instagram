        "body": "Photographer Jay Tyrrell explores the realm of “inner space” through the medium of photography. Inner space, or the world of atoms, remains largely the realm of the imagination. What would the inside of a molecule of glucose look like if you were a \"micronaut\"– his term for someone who travels into this landscape? For Tyrrell, atoms of carbon might appear as orange fire; hydrogen, blazing yellow; and oxygen, a glowing green. Atoms of radioactive elements might appear as cold as deep space, without color and with surfaces reflecting energy back into the universe. Atomic Mirrors reflects Tyrrell’s creative connection to his childhood, as he seeks to artistically expand the idea of the universe and explore the beauty of an imagined atomic landscape. #JayTyrrell's \"Atomic Mirrors\" is on display, pre-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/1Xq2Azb",
