        "body": "For thirty years, Marguerite Wildenhain taught more than twenty students each summer to master the art of wheel-thrown pottery, influencing several generations of studio potters. From 1950 to 1980, students wound their way up the steep dirt road to Pond Farm, renting rooms or camping nearby in order to attend Wildenhain’s school. Students spent each day at their wheels mastering various throwing techniques and creating hundreds of forms—from dog bowls, a surprisingly difficult shape to master, to flowerpots, bowls, cups, and plates. Since Wildenhain emphasized technique, her students did not fire or glaze their wares, but instead focused on the process, leaving Pond Farm with knowledge and skills rather than finished goods. Learn more about Marguerite Wildenhain's amazing life in \"A Potter’s Life: Marguerite Wildenhain” at #PondFarm, on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/PondFarm",
