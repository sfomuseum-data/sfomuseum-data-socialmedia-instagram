        "body": "Artwork by Nubia Ortega of Creativity Explored is featured in our exhibition \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\". Nubia Ortega joined the Creativity Explored studio in 2003 and experiments with different types of media. Whether in pencil, paint, or clay, her artwork is very realistic and detail-oriented. A focused artist, Nubia spends ample time on each piece, first methodically laying out a composition and then carefully choosing colors to fill in her landscapes and portraits. Most recently, Ortega has excelled at clay hand-building techniques, creating stylized human figures and plant forms and firing them with ultra-colorful glazes. The modern furniture and home décor company, CB2, chose Ortega’s work to display on their 2010 limited-edition holiday ornaments, and her work has been exhibited in several exhibitions at Creativity Explored in San Francisco. Here’s a glimpse of the artist at work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTPi8Dhu9rM \"Celebrating a Vision: #ArtAndDisability\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ArtAndDisability",
