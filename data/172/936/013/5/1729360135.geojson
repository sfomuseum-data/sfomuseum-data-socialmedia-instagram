        "body": "This 1936 #United Air Lines fall and winter suit in sage green wool was worn over a vivid yellow linen blouse. The slimmer cut of the one-button jacket, with squared shoulders, deep gorge, and wide notched lapel, accentuates the blouse and the string bow tie of dark green ribbon. The straight skirt has an inverted kick pleat at the front. A sailor cap-style pillbox hat was worn with a green and yellow flat bow at the front. #WomenInAviation  See more fashion in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" on display, pre-security in the Aviation Museum and Library and the Main Hall of the International Terminal.
