        "body": "Good design was modern and organic, based on simple structures, clean lines, and honest materials. The “Cobra” lamp by Greta Magnusson-Grossman (1906–99), with its asymmetrical shade and curved base connected by flexible arm, was selected for the 1950 “Good Design” exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. Educated at the Konstfack College of Design in Stockholm, Magnusson-Grossman worked in architecture, and interior and industrial design, and was one of the first to introduce modern Scandinavian design to the California marketplace with her move to Los Angeles in 1940.
