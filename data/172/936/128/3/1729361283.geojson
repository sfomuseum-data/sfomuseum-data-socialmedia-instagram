This exhibition presented many of Japan’s ceramic styles from the Medieval period (late 1100s–late 1500s) to the twentieth century—from glazed stoneware, to teabowls and porcelain food-serving vessels, as well as a variety of underglaze blue and overglaze enamel porcelains. Check out our current exhibition “Mingei: Traditional Japanese Arts”, featuring more Japanese ceramics, pre-security, in the International Terminal.",
