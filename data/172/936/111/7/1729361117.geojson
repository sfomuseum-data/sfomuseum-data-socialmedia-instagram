One of the first meals to be served on early flights was fried chicken because fried chicken was still good cold and kept well. In 1929, after in the introduction of the Boeing 80, United Air Lines served fried chicken, a bag of potato chips and an apple on almost every flight. With the implementation of the first flight kitchen in 1936, United could now provide hot food to their passengers. On the DC-3, United still served fried chicken, now served hot, as an option for passengers. After the food was prepared at the flight kitchen at the airport, the fried chicken was usually served in heavy paper inside a paper-mâché box to provide insulation.",
