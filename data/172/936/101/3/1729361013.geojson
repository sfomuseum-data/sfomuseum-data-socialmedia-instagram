The contents of this particular medical kit, housed in a brown metal box, were: gauze, triangular bandages, and a canvas kit containing a thermometer, snakebite kit, aspirin, water purifiers, smelling salts, and other first aid medicines. Kits such as this one were supplied on Clippers for the multi-day journeys across the Pacific Ocean and their island bases were staffed with medical professionals. “China Clipper\" is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal.
