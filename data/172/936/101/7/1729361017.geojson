        "body": "Pacific Air Lines began as a business endeavor to train pilots during World War II. It was founded by Hollywood and Broadway agent and producer Leland Hayward and TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air) board of directors member John Howard Connelly, and financed by Hollywood actors and executives, including James Stewart and Darryl Zanuck. In 1958, Pacific Air Lines updated its Navajo-inspired thunderbird logo to a bright and modern red, white, and blue depiction. The next year, the airline added the pressurized Martin 4-0-4, and the turboprop Fairchild F-27 to its fleet. Learn more about California regional airlines in our exhibition, “Catch Our Style: California Regional Airlines 1950s-1980s”, on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from Sunday through Friday, 10am to 4:30pm.",
