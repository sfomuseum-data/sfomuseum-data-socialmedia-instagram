In late 2012, archivists Andrew Lampert and John Klacsmann invited New York City photographer and Guggenheim Fellow Jason Fulford to photograph Smith’s extant collection of 251 paper airplanes collected off the streets of New York City between the years 1961 and 1983. Smith dutifully annotated each plane with information including the date and location where he found it, and sometimes even the time of day and weather conditions.  Harry Smith’s Paper Airplane Collection, photographed by Jason Fulford is on display, pre-security, in Terminal 3.",
