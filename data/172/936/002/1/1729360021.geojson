        "body": "One of the first American modernist jewelers, Margaret De Patta (1903–64) referred to her jewelry as “wearable sculpture.” In a departure from traditional jewelry that focused on precious gemstones, De Patta’s work balanced the entire composition, with quartz, pearls, or beach pebbles added as accents in flowing harmony. Another San Francisco jeweler, Peter Macchiarini (1909–2001) championed handcrafted art and the role of craft artisans. Much of his work was abstract, with geometric forms inspired by African tribal art, Cubism, musical instruments, and elements of nature.
