The cropped, tuxedo-style jacket has the wide lapels, padded shoulders, and narrow waist of Saint Laurent’s 1980s power-suit designs for his Rive Gauche label. Terracotta collar and cuff trim project a regimental formality, while the colorful Qantas flying kangaroo pattern of the cotton-poly skirt and blouse adds a festive air.  See \"Fashion In Flight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
