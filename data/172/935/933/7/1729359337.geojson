        "body": "United Airlines traces its origin to the mid-1920s, with the establishment of four airmail routes that would later become the backbone of United’s route system. The airmail service pilots flew in open-cockpit biplanes, fully exposed to the wind and weather conditions. They had no radios, no radar, and the only way to navigate was by compass and the pilot’s own knowledge of landmarks on the ground below. The only creature comforts available were what the pilots carried, like the occasional thermos of coffee. It was challenging work, but well-liked by the fliers. These pilots constituted a large group of experienced long-distance aviators who would later become the nation’s first generation of airline pilots.
