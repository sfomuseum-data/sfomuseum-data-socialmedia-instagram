He can see the Tiber…the broad green Campagna, stretching away toward the mountains, with its scattered arches and broken aqueducts of the olden time, so picturesque in their gray ruin, and so daintily festooned with vines…He can see a panorama that is varied, extensive, beautiful to the eye, and more illustrious in history than any other in Europe.” Mark Twain, The Innocents Abroad (1869)  Learn more about Rome in \"All Roads Lead to #Rome: 17th–19th Century Architectural Souvenirs from the Collection of #Piraneseum\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AllRoadsRome ",
