        "body": "In his project, \"Sidereal Rift\", artist Michael Light draws focus on the seemingly endless grid of Los Angeles at night. Made over the course of a single evening from a helicopter, Light photographed the glowing arteries of Southern California as they emerged from the darkened landscape below. Light produces images that reveal the web-like structure of the city, defined by the light it generates. Visually referencing the way molten lava flows through cracks in the earth’s surface to reveal glowing rifts of energy and heat, Light’s images of Los Angeles evoke a sense of awe and offer a place to ponder the rapid development and sheer scale of cities worldwide.  See \"Sidereal Rift\" by Michael Light, on display post-security, on the departures level of Terminal 3. https://www.flysfo.com/museum/exhibitions/michael-light-sidereal-rift . . .",
