Over the next twenty-seven years, from 1961 to 1988, Chavez built twenty-seven models for the restaurant with occasional assistance from his friend Robert Fogg. The models in the Nut Tree Restaurant and Airfield Model Aircraft Collection represent aircraft of historic importance. In 1996, after 75 years of successful operation, the Nut Tree Restaurant closed. In 1997, the majority of the collection was acquired by SFO Museum.  The Chavez Models can be found pre-security in Terminal 3, on the arrivals level. http://bit.ly/1XoaUil  Image: Fokker T.II (F.IV) model airplane, 05/1968. SFO Museum Collection. 1996.26.03",
