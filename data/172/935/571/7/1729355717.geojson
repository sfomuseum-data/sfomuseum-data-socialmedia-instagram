Driven by a thriving postwar economy, designers utilized bold styling to transform everyday objects into visually expressive items, and manufacturers unleashed an array of products to keep pace with demand. Stores carried everything from portable televisions and pocket-sized radios to space-age toys and plastic dinnerware sets. \"The Modern Consumer: 1950s Products and Style\" is on display post-security in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
