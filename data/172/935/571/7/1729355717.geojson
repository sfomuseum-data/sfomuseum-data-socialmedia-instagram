        "body": "This is your last week to see “The Modern Consumer — 1950s Products and Style”! A new wave of consumerism swept across the United States during the 1950s. Driven by a thriving postwar economy, designers utilized bold styling to transform everyday objects into visually expressive items, and manufacturers unleashed an array of products to keep pace with demand. Stores carried everything from portable televisions and pocket-sized radios to space-age toys and plastic dinnerware sets. \"The Modern Consumer: 1950s Products and Style\" is on display post-security in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
