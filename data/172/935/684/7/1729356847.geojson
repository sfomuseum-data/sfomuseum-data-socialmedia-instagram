        "body": "Arhoolie Records’ subsidiary label Blues Classics was the first to reintroduce the work of Memphis Minnie (1897–1973) to a new (and largely white) audience. A highly influential blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter, Minnie was born in Louisiana. Her family moved to Walls, Mississippi; the singer ran away to nearby Memphis in her early teens and got her start playing the guitar for tips on city streets. The tough, street-smart Minnie enjoyed a successful career performing and recording for various blues labels beginning in the 1920s and continuing well into the 1950s.  Memphis Minnie received royalties of fifty cents a record for each of the Blues Classics albums of hers that sold. In this letter that Memphis Minnie wrote to Chris Strachwitz, she asks him to send her one of the recordings as a keepsake and tells him, “I would like to hear myself all over again.” She also expresses her disappointment that Strachwitz was unable to include “Bumble Bee” because that was her favorite song and her first “hit.” \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
