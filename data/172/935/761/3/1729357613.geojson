        "body": "Did you know our exhibition, \"On The Radio\" is full of local Bay Area history? During the 1920s, some of the best-performing, commercially made crystal radio sets such as the wooden one shown here were manufactured by Uncle Al’s Radio Shop in Oakland, California. Marketed as the Miracle, they used tuning circuits with multiple coils and variable condensers. The sensitivity of Uncle Al’s tuning circuits allowed these radios to select individual stations in metropolitan areas with many frequencies, such as the San Francisco Bay Area. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://ow.ly/CV1050jiWzy . . .",
