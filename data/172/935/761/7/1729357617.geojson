        "body": "An ancient Chinese creation myth tells of a time when the world was new and the gods appointed cats to oversee life. As the story goes, the cats did not take to the seriousness of their task and preferred to doze in sunbeams and play with falling cherry blossoms. The management of earthly duties was transferred to humans, and cats have since indulged themselves in the more relaxing aspects of life. Many other myths surround the cat in Chinese culture. Some insist that cats can see spirits in the dark, which may explain the prevalence of cat-shaped night-lights such as this one during the latter part of the Ming Dynasty (1368â€“1644). A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
