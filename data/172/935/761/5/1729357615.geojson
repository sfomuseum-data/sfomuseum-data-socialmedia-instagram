        "body": "With the introduction of flight service to Japan and Asia during the postwar era, beverage service began to incorporate the traditional customs of the cultures from these lands. Generally, these included small, handleless ceramic teacups and teapots that were slightly smaller than those traditionally used for Western-style tea and coffee. Asian motifs were often featured in the glaze. Japan Air Lines was one of the first airlines to offer this service, and by the 1960s other airlines with routes to Japan and Asia followed. Have you ever had Japanese-style tea service on an aircraft?  Image: JAL (Japan Air Lines), Douglas DC-8, meal service, mid 1960s. Gift of Thomas G. Dragges. 2010.039.001.006",
