        "body": "During the 1970s and 1980s, vinyl LP records with international-travel themes sometimes included cover art with airliners. The widely acclaimed Ganddal Girls Choir from the Ganddal District of Sandnes, Norway, toured through much of Scandinavia, Europe, and North America on SAS Scandinavian Airlines System and appeared disembarking from a SAS McDonnell Douglas DC-9 with two of the airline’s flight attendants on their 1968 album “How Great Thou Art.” The Ganddal Pikekor (translated as girls choir) consists of six choirs in all totaling over 350 girls. From this large group, the best singers are chosen, forming the smaller choir pictured on the album cover. Most of these girls are about 19 to 20 years of age and have been singing in the Pikekor for as many as eight years. Their costumes are a delight to the eye and their singing most pleasant to the ear. Their program is varied and versatile, consisting of sacred songs as well as cherished Scandinavian folk songs and Gospel hymns.
