        "body": "Taken around 1936 in a Douglas DC-3, this promotional TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air) photo advertises their complimentary meal service. At the time, these planes held up to 21 passengers and cruised at 175â€“200 miles per hour. The DC-3 was unpressurized and flew at lower altitudes than modern pressurized jetliners, usually below 10,000 feet. In spite of often flying around stormy weather, DC-3 flights still encountered plenty of turbulence at these altitudes. Though the food looks delicious, air sickness occurred frequently.
