        "body": "One of the oldest forms of footwear in India, the paduka, a toe-knob sandal with an elevated sole, is still worn today. For hundreds of centuries, this ancient design has kept the foot elevated above the hot earth while protecting feet from ground debris. Commonly made from solid wood, some finer pairs were intricately carved in the shape of fish, which symbolize fertility and abundance. Although all classes wore padukas, finer materials and intricate adornment reflect the status of their wearers. Religious teachers or holy men often wore padukas, and pilgrims on religious journeys occasionally wore wooden padukas with metal spikes.  See more shoes from all over the world in \"Stepping Out: Shoes in World Culture\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ShoesinCulture",
