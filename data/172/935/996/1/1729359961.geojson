The mosque was founded by Afghan Rohilla leader Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech (1723–74). He established his capital in North India and was later killed in battle in 1774. The regal structure was built in the late Mughal style. The human figures in this particular aquatint appear smaller in size than they would appear in real life.  All objects from this exhibition are from the collection of Michael Sack.
