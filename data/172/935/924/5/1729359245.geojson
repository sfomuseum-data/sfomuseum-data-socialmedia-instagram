        "body": "In the mid-1930s, L.C. Smith \u0026 Corona offered an “Animal Keyboard” option on their popular Silent, Sterling, and Standard portable typewriters. Marketed to teach children to type, these rare, Depression-era machines included a set of finger rings that corresponded with illustrated animals on the keys. Keyboard columns were color-coordinated to the finger rings and featured animals such as bluebirds, bear cubs, kittens, and bunny rabbits. An illustrated play book was included, and color-coordinated keyboards were also offered without animal keys as instructional devices for older children.  Learn more about the typewriter in our exhibition, \"The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing\", post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Thetypewriter",
