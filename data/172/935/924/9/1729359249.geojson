        "body": "Have you seen the beautiful wallpaper featured on the back panels in our \"At Home with Arts and Crafts\" exhibition? All of the wallpaper was hand-printed by Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers. Founded in 1979 by Bruce Bradbury, the company first began reproducing and reinterpreting historic patterns for Victorian era interiors. In the early 1990s, after a decade of research on original bungalow interiors, Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury released their first collection of designs for the Arts and Crafts revival, intended for historic properties built between 1900 and 1920. All of their art wallpapers are hand silkscreened in their Benicia, California, studio.  Special thanks to Bradbury \u0026 Bradbury Art Wallpapers for providing the hand silk-screened wallpapers in this exhibition.  See the gorgeous wallpaper on display in “At Home with Arts and Crafts” located, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/SFOArtsandCrafts",
