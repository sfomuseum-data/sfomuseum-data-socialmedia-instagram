        "body": "United Air Lines introduced hot meal service on Douglas DST (Douglas Sleeper Transport) and DC-3 flights in the late 1930s. On the DC-3, one of the first airliners to be equipped with a galley, meals were served with paper or plastic cups and plates to reduce weight. Lightweight plastic cups, saucers, and plates were produced by Hemco Plastics and Plastics, Inc., while paper cups were made of sturdy “Nestrite” by the Lily-Tulip Cup Company of New York. Ceramic wares were specifically designed to be light, yet sturdy, for inflight use. Plates were produced by the Shenango China Company of New Castle, Pennsylvania, while casserole dishes were manufactured by Hall China of East Liverpool, Ohio. Silver-plated flatware was offered with most types of meal service. One set featured the same “Embossed” art deco pattern incorporated on the airline’s blue plastic dishes.
