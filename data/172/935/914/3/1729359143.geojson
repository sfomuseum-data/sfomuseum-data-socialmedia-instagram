Operating three Fiat G-212s, three Savoia Marchetti SM 95C, and three Curtiss C-46s, SAIDE also flew from Cairo to Paris, Benghazi, Tripoli, Milan, and Tunis. SAIDE only lasted for five years and in 1952, the airline was acquired by EgyptAir, the current flag carrier of Egypt.  Image: SAIDE (Service Aériens Internationaux d’Egypte) postcard, c. 1950.
