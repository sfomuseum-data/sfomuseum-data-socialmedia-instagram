        "body": "#Onthisday in 1954, the new Terminal Building at SFO was dedicated. The upper level was for departures and the lower level was for arrivals, each with its own roadway. A spacious restaurant named the International Room provided panoramic views of the airfield. In addition to the new radar, radio, and lighting systems, airfield improvements at the time included parallel runways for simultaneous take-off and landings.  As SFO had reached 2 million passengers by 1952, this new facility could accommodate several million additional passengers. The dedication ceremony for the new Terminal was a three-day event that drew hundreds of thousands of visitors.  Later called the Central Terminal, the building has been modified several times over the years and, now named Terminal 2, it is still part of SFO.
