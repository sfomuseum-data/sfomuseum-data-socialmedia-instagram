        "body": "Straw, the byproduct of rice and other plant life, served as one of the most plentiful materials for crafting items in Japan. Some of the many items made from straw include clothing, shoes, hats, and containers. The oldest style of shoes still worn in Japan consists of sandals made of straw twisted into ropes and plaited to form the sandalâ€™s sole, with the ropes acting as straps. Known as waraji, they were traditionally worn by peasants and probably introduced from China in the eighth century. In addition to sandals, straw boots are called fukagutsu. They are still worn today in snowy, mountainous regions of Japan. They differ stylistically in height and shape depending on the area where they are made and the amount of snowfall.  Shoes courtesy of the Mingei International Museum. See more shoes from all over the world in \"Stepping Out: Shoes in World Culture\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ShoesinCulture",
