        "body": "Pan American pioneered the multiple flight crew concept for long-range ocean transports. Requirements were based on six areas of need: expert direction of the flight; piloting; navigation; control and care of power plants; maintenance of communication; and passenger service. This called for a cross-trained crew of up to ten. Captains qualified as Master of Ocean Flying Boats. A First Officer was second-in-command, while the Second Officer, a senior pilot-in-training, assumed navigation duties. The Flight Radio Officer was responsible for the communications equipment and maintained constant contact with radio-control stations ashore and the station ships located at specific ocean quadrants. A Flight Engineer monitored and maintained the mechanical operation of the aircraft utilizing up to forty-one instruments and the throttles, carburetor settings, and fuel supply valves located at his station. A Third Officer, Fourth Officer, Assistant Flight Engineer, Assistant Radio Officer, and Assistant Flight Steward rounded out the crew.
