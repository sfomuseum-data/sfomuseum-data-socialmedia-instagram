        "body": "In 1935, in response to a request for a large-capacity, long-range airliner from United Air Lines, Douglas began developing the DC-4. Soon, American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, and Pan American Airways expressed interest. The prototype was a large, pressurized, four-engine airliner with a capacity for fifty-two passengers. It also featured a low-profile triple tail in order to fit into aircraft hangers of the period. It first flew in 1938. However, the aircraft was deemed too large and complicated, with performance was well below expectations. As a result, it was completely redesigned. A smaller, less complicated, unpressurized design was developed instead, which became the DC-4. The original prototype, then re-designated the DC-4E to differentiate between the two, was sold to the Empire of Japan.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
