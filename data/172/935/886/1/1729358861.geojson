        "body": "#Onthisday in 1935, the inaugural transpacific Pan American Airways Clipper service landed in Manila from California carrying 110,865 letters. In Manila, the crew, led by Captain Edwin Musick, was treated to an elaborate welcoming ceremony with an estimated 250,000 people in attendance. The flight to Manila covered 8,210 miles with a flying time of 59 hours and 48 minutes. These days, a nonstop flight from SFO to Manila takes around 15 hours.  Our exhibition detailing the entire adventurous endeavor, \"China Clipper\", is on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open from daily, 10am to 4:30pm.
