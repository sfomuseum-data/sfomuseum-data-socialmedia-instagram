        "body": "Born in England in 1964, Annu Palakunnathu Matthew spent her teenage years living in India before moving to the United States, where she currently resides. In her series, \"Memories of India\", Matthew returns to India to produce ethereal images of daily life in her cultural homeland. As an artist who relates to multiple cultures, Matthew works with the sense of someone who is both an insider and an outsider, creating images that are nostalgic and familiar, while also evoking a sense of discovery. We are left with dreamlike moments that recall the sights, smells, and sounds of India, seen through the lens of Matthewâ€™s memory.  See \"Memories of India\" by Annu Palakunnathu Matthew, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2zDKPGU",
