        "body": "Japanese designer Hanae Mori (b. 1926) started her fashion career in Tokyo for the film industry in the 1950s and began presenting haute couture in Paris in 1977. Moriâ€™s second JAL uniform, debuted in 1977 and worn until 1987, took a distinct turn toward nostalgic traditionalism bordering on irony. The familiar dark blue polyester of the one-piece dress and jacket combines contemporary materials, and a flouncy scarf, with playful references to the earlier regimental looks in the epaulettes, gold buttons, and kepi cap with a dramatic return to the below-the-knee hemline.  See \"Fashion In Flight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
