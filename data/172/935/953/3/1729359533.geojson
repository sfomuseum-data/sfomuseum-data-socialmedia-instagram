        "body": "The first commercial pressurized transport aircraft was the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, which first flew in 1938. Pressurization meant that the fuselage was sealed and, when at a high altitude, the aircraft could maintain interior pressure as if it were at a lower altitude. Pressurization allowed the Stratocruiser to cruise at 14,000 feet. TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air) and Pan American Airways promoted the aircraft as having the capability of flying “above the weather” instead of through it, which meant a smoother overall flight compared to other non-pressurized airliners of the period. The Boeing 307 had a cruise speed of 215 miles per hour and could hold up to 38 passengers.  Image:  Pan American Airways, Boeing 307 Stratoliner, c. 1940. Gift of Vernon W. Smith. 1999.562.011",
