The creator of the rainbow flag, Gilbert Baker, assigned symbolic meaning to each of the colors—pink for sexuality, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for art, indigo for peace and harmony, and purple for spirit. The rainbow represents the LGBT community’s diversity.  Photograph courtesy of Mick Hicks.
