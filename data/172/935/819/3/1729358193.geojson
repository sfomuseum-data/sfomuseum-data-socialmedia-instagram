It offered hundreds of updated features including new reclining seats, upgraded air conditioning, comfortable sleeping berths, and well-appointed lavatories. Qantas designed its cabin for forty passengers in a roomy, premium-service configuration—later configurations seated as many as eighty passengers. This poster offers views of the airliner’s interior including the cabin and cockpit. Have you ever flown on Qantas?  Image: Qantas Empire Airways poster, Lockheed Constellation, 1950s.
