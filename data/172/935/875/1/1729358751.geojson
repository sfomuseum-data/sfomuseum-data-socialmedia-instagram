Only three Martin M-130 flying boats were built and they were the largest commercial airplane when delivered in 1935. They were named \"Hawaii Clipper\", \"Philippine Clipper\", and \"China Clipper\". When the \"China Clipper\" inaugurated service to Asia, the name became synonymous in the public’s mind with all of Pan American’s Pacific flying boats.  Learn more about China Clipper in our exhibition, on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/chinaclipper  Image: Pan American Airways, Martin M-130 “China Clipper”, c. 1939.
