        "body": "In 1891, basketball—associated with sneakers more than any other sport—was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Canadian-American James Naismith. The U.S. Rubber Company began selling sneakers using the name Keds in 1917. The same year, the Converse Rubber Shoe Company, which initially made rubber galoshes, released the famous Converse All-Star basketball sneaker, a canvas high top with a patch on the ankle. When basketball player and coach Charles Hollis “Chuck” Taylor began endorsing the sneaker in 1921, its popularity skyrocketed. In 1934, he became the first person to have his name on sneakers.
