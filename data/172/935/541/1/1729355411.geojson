        "body": "In his essay, “Shadows of Change”, the late photographer and photojournalist Stanley Greene visits the town of Uummannaq in central-western Greenland and draws focus on the effects of climate change in the region. In Uummannaq, Inuit traditions of hunting and fishing have historically revolved around seasonal changes in weather. In a region where cultural traditions and livelihoods are largely dependent on the formation and reliability of seasonal ice, changes in climate are felt as a change in basic environment and way of life. Greene chronicles these changes in a series of quiet images that portray a landscape and its people in flux, and offer a place for us to meditate on a future where the effects of climate will only become more visible. “Shadows of Change“ by Stanley Greene, is on display, post security in Terminal 3 by Gate F5.
