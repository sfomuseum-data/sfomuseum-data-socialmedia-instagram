Within a year, the young airline was responsible for delivering 40% of the volume of the nation's airmail on its Los Angeles mail service. Western Air Express changed its name to Western Airlines in 1941 and was acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1986.  Image: Western Air Express route map, system map, c. 1929. Gift of Edwin I.
