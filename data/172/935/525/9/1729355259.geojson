        "body": "Happy #InternationalNursesDay! Many stewardesses and air hostesses hired before World War II were registered nurses. In the early days of aviation, aircraft were unpressurised and flew at low altitudes through turbulent weather formations, which often created very bumpy rides. Passengers were often sick on flights, and the cabin crew nurses were there to ease the journey as much as they could.  SFO Museum would like to thank nurses everywhere for all of your hard work and dedication.  Image:  Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air (TWA), air hostesses, 1935.
