        "body": "During the Vietnam War, commercial airliners along with their crews were chartered to fly US troops into combat zones. Soldiers no longer deployed to the war zone with their units, but as individuals or in small groups for distribution to their units upon arrival. A typical charter flight of about 200 people included members of dozens of different units and all branches of service. Veterans recall this as an isolating and disorienting experience. These feelings of isolation and confusion made the efforts of the flight attendants critical. Flight attendants remember the passengers being very respectful to them.  Learn more about these chartered flights in “Flying the Freedom Birds: Airlines and the Vietnam War.” See the online exhibition at: http://bit.ly/FreedomBirds",
