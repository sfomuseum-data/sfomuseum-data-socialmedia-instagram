Operated by a crew of three, the captain, the first officer, and the flight engineer, the Concorde's cockpit was divided into three different sections designed for each operator. The Front Dash Panel Controls, operated by the pilot and the first officer, are shown in this photo. The flight engineers station behind them is not shown. Noteworthy in this photo is that the pilot in the first officers seat is also a captain with four stripes on his epaulettes. Starting in April we will also have a whole photography show on airline cockpits! Stay tuned!  Image:  Concorde promotional print, c. 1980. Gift of the William Hough Collection. 2016.097.007 . . .",
