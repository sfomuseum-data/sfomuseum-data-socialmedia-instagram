        "body": "America’s fascination with the automobile reached new heights during the postwar years. From 1945–55, the number of cars on American roads doubled, and throughout the 1950s, dealers sold more than seven million cars and trucks every year. Automobile toys made from die-cast steel, molded plastic, and printed tin mirrored their full-sized counterparts. Japanese and German toy makers engineered some of the more advanced toys. These tin lithograph cars featured friction or electric motors, and battery-operated accessories, including working lights and convertible tops. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
