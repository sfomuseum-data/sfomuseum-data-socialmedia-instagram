Using the World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF) network to locate individuals and communities practicing subsistence farming and using renewable energy sources, Bruy visited people living in remote areas ranging from the Carpathian Mountains in Romania to the Rockies in Colorado. Using a medium format film camera, Bruy documents his encounters, offering a glimpse into a world of isolation, and wilderness. \"Scrublands\" by Antoine Bruy is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2sFJVY3",
