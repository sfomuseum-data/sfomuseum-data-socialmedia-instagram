        "body": "From coast to coast, regions of North America developed distinctive types of hand-carved duck decoys. Master craftsmen created local styles that were passed on through generations of carvers. Artisans also brought their own individual creativity to the birds they crafted, making each one unique. Carvers made some decoys to appear sleeping, preening, or with their heads tucked low into their bodies as if resting.  Duck decoy courtesy of the collection Paul A. Mazzilli. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
