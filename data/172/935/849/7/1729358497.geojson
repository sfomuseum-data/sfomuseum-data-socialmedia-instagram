San Francisco-based artist RJ Muna has been photographing dance in the Bay Area for over twenty years and has been collaborating with Alonzo King LINES Ballet since 2009. Muna's long-standing relationship with the company has created an understanding of King's artistic point of view, which allows him to capture the authenticities of King's choreography on film. This creative collaboration has influenced the artists on both sides of the camera and has inspired a synthesis between movement and still image. \"Alonzo King LINES\" by RJ Muna is on display post-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2BMOgvq",
