        "body": "In her series “Surface Tension”, Tabitha Soren (b.1967) examines our complex relationship with technology and draws focus on our increasingly tactile connection to visual information. Using a large-format film camera, Soren photographs tablet screens to reveal the marks left behind—the fingerprints, smudges, and oily residue of our engagement with the images below the surface. Soren collects from a range of source material include web searches, text messages, social media content, and personal pictures. Brought together, Soren’s images serve as a poignant meditation on the role of digital devices in society and offer a reminder of the traces, both physical and digital, that we leave behind when using them.  See “Surface Tension” by #TabithaSoren (@tabithasoren) on display, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2lNfKLK",
