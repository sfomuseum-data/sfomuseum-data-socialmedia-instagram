        "body": "#Onthisday in 1956, the Lockheed Constellation L-1649 Starliner embarked on its maiden flight. The final variant in Lockheed’s Constellation series, the L-1649 Starliner embodied the zenith in large-capacity, piston-engine airliner development. Initial deliveries went to TWA (Trans World Airlines), which inaugurated service on its New York, London, and Frankfurt route in July 1957. The airline also inaugurated trans-polar service between the U.S. West Coast and Europe with the Starliner the same year. Named the “Jetstream” by TWA, the airliner featured updated modern interiors with murals by Howard Hughes’ chief artist and designer Mario Zamparelli.
