Merrill Collection” features work by the husband and wife team of woodworker Bob Stocksdale (1913–2003) and textile artist Kay Sekimachi (b. 1926)? Stocksdale had a masterful talent for revealing dramatic patterns hidden below the surface of rare wood. Sekimachi transformed thread, paper, and organic materials into delightfully expressive textiles, vessels, and sculpture. Married in 1972, Stocksdale and Sekimachi refined their craft together for over three decades, sharing a love of form and innovation in craft.  See \"California Studio Craft: Featuring Works from the Forrest L. Merrill Collection\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/CaliforniaCrafts",
