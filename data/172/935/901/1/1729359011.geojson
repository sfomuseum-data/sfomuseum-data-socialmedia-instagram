Standing 221 feet tall, the new tower is seismically fitted to withstand a magnitude 8 earthquake and protected against lightning strikes. The tower cab offers almost 270 degrees views of the air field. SFOâ€™s air traffic control tower was a partnership between the FAA and the City and County of San Francisco; the city commissioned the construction of the new control tower and base building began in summer 2012, with the FAA installing air traffic control equipment in the building and conducting training and testing in 2015.
