        "body": "The Remler Company manufactured radio receivers in downtown San Francisco for more than three decades. Founded in 1918 by Elmer Cunningham (1889-1965), a local maker of radio vacuum tubes, The Remler Company reorganized in a new plant at 2101 Bryant Street in 1931 and made tabletop radios, console sets, and electrical components. In the mid-1930s, Remler introduced the \"Scottie\" dog logo, likely influenced by Fala, the famous Scottish terrier owned by president Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945). Remler's unique styling ranged from plastic-case sets with upholstered-motifs, to radios in striking glass enclosures and modern wooden cases. Some Remlers had a unique \"dual\" chassis that allowed for AC electricity or DC battery power; others such as the Model 330 portable operated on battery power alone.  Radio courtesy of Jaime Arbona. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
