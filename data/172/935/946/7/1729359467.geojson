With the new jet service in 1962, Cathay redesigned cabin crew uniforms in red and white. Introduced in 1969, this uniform reflects the fashion of the times. Made in red polyester, the A-line mini-dress is matched by a fitted princess seam jacket with high collar and accessorized by a simple white silk scarf. The contemporary look of the suit is balanced with the traditional touch of the mandarin style hat. \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
