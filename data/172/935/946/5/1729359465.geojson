        "body": "On August 27, 1954, the new Central Terminal at SFO was dedicated. The terminal employed an innovative two-level design. The upper level was for departures and the lower level was for arrivals, each with its own roadway. A spacious restaurant named the International Room provided panoramic views of the airfield. In addition to the new radar, radio, and lighting systems, airfield improvements at the time included parallel runways for simultaneous take-off and landings. The Central Terminal dedication ceremony was a three-day event that drew hundreds of thousands of visitors.  The Central Terminal has been modified several times since its conception, but it is still part of SFO as Terminal 2.
