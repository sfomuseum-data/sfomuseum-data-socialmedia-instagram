        "body": "Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s view of the Pantheon presents the temple much larger than its actual height. Tiny figures atop its 142-foot dome and at the base of its portico exaggerate the scale of this iconic structure. Piranesi details the temple’s degraded exterior—stripped of much of its marble cladding—and includes vegetation sprouting from its rooftop. The current structure was built in the early 2nd century CE by Hadrian, who incorporated the inscription of the original building on the new facade, a common practice during Hadrian’s rebuilding projects.  All objects are from the Collection of Piraneseum. See \"All Roads Lead to #Rome: 17th–19th Century Architectural Souvenirs from the Collection of #Piraneseum\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AllRoadsRome ",
