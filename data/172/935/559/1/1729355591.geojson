Check out this video that shows the work by wallpaper installation specialists and SFO Museum staff in the paper mounting, review, and exhibition installation.  The first edition of Views of North America was offered in 1834 and designed by Jean-Julien Deltil (1791–1863). The entire panoramic wallpaper requires 1,690 printing blocks, 223 colors, and thirty-two lengths totaling forty-nine feet. “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” is on display, pre-security in the International Terminal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKA0zYj8P_s",
