Wiley says of his work during this time: “It suddenly became clear to me that art was what I’d heard on the radio that day, or something I saw outside. Suddenly, anything was potential.” This work was originally created and installed as an outdoor billboard prior to being purchased by the Arts Commission for the Airport. \"Void\" by William T. Wiley is located post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2wkT33r",
