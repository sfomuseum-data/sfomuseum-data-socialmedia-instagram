        "body": "Introduced in 1951, the Lockheed 1049 Super Constellation was an improved, long-range, stretched version of the 049 Constellation. The Super Constellation was designed primarily to compete with the Douglas DC-6 on transatlantic routes. The cabin design was developed by the industrial design firm of Henry Dreyfuss Associates. Divided into four sections, it was conceived to minimize the effect of the long-tube view when looking down the cabin. The interiors could also be arranged in a multitude of color and fabric combinations. Introduced in 1955, the Lockheed 1049G Super Constellation, or “Super G,” was the ultra long-range version of the aircraft and included wingtip tanks.
