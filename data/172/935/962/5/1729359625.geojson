        "body": "The major influence in British punk fashion, Dame Vivienne Westwood (b. 1941) created London street fashion in the seventies and began showing in Paris in 1981. She brought her unique style to Virgin Atlantic in 2014 with this current uniform to match the airline’s maverick attitude. In signature red, the exquisitely tailored suit recalls 1940s couture and Westwood’s earlier nipped-waist Bettina jacket with a darted pencil skirt. A high collar and asymmetric frilled jacquard blouse underscore the Anglocentric qualities of this forward-looking design. \"#FashionInFlight: A Photo Album\" is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/FIFPhotos",
