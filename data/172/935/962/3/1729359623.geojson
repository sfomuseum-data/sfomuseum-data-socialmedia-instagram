        "body": "In an era before surfboards had leashes and prior to corporate sponsorship, Jeff Divine captured the burgeoning sport of surfing on 35mm film. Divine documented a host of legendary surfers in the water and also the colorful surf culture of the time. This image shows a lone corduroy-clad surfer walking down a path toward the beach. An old sign perched in front of him spray painted with the mantra of Point Loma surfers reads: “If you don't live here, don't surf here! NO UNLOCALS.” \"1970s Surf Photography\" by #JeffDivine is on display, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2lkXLta ",
