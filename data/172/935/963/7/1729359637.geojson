        "body": "#Onthisday in 1988, the last branded PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines) flight, #1486, departed San Diego at 10:35 PM and landed in Las Vegas as a USAir flight.  In 1949, Kenny Friedkin, a flight trainer and test pilot, formed Pacific Southwest Airlines or PSA. Based out of San Diegoâ€™s Lindbergh Field, where Friedkin previously ran a flight school, the airline began weekly round-trip flights between San Diego and Oakland with a single leased Douglas DC-3. By the end of the decade, the airline offered nearly one hundred flights a week to numerous destinations throughout the state. By offering discounted fares, easy check-ins, and friendly, on-time service, the airline quickly attracted a sizable, loyal customer base, which included businessmen, tourists, and sailors from San Diego.  During the 1980s, PSA grew, but struggled financially. The purchase of new McDonnell Douglas Super 80s (an updated version of the DC-9) and British Aerospace BAe 146 regional jetliners resulted in a large amount of debt for the carrier. By the mid- 1980s, overexpansion and excessive debt left PSA vulnerable to a takeover, and in 1986, after nearly four decades of operation in California, the airline was acquired by USAir.
