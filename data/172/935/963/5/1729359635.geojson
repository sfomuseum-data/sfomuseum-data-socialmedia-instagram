        "body": "Convent \u0026 Stuart Hall  is one of more than two hundred Sacred Heart schools, an international network that offers an innovative values-based program rich in the arts, math, science, and the humanities. As part of the school’s International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, Convent \u0026 Stuart Hall juniors produced “Window to the World”. The exhibition approaches travel as more than a route between origin and destination, but rather, an experience that provides a different perspective from which to view our world. Featuring the work of twenty-eight students who interpret this theme using varied stylistic approaches and mediums ranging from painting to photography, “Window to the World” visually explores the experience of travel from both an individual and a collective standpoint.
