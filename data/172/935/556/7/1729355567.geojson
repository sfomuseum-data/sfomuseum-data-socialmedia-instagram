        "body": "Founded in 2011, Art School of San Francisco Bay grew from the desire to teach classical art skills to students in a manner that appeals to a wide audience. The organization offers a weekly Manga Drawing Club consisting of children and teens. Manga, a popular Japanese art in the form of comic books, tells stories through pictures and words. The club provides a safe learning environment. Students can collaborate on stories and drawings and explore what they love about them under the guidance of classically trained and open-minded teachers who enjoy the craft as much as the students. The artwork in this exhibition was created by Art School of San Francisco Bay’s Manga Drawing Club students ages ten to seventeen.  See drawings from Art School of San Francisco Bay’s Manga Drawing Club, on display, pre-security, on the arrivals level of Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2v4hapo",
