Founded after World War II as Maszovlet (short for Magyar–Szovjet Polgári Légiforgalmi Részvénytársaság, or \"Hungarian-Soviet Civil Air Transport Joint Stock Company\"), the airline was jointly owned by Hungary and the USSR. In 1954, Hungary acquired the Soviet Union's shares in Maszovlet and the company was renamed Malev Hungarian Airlines. Did you ever fly on Malev Hungarian Airlines?
