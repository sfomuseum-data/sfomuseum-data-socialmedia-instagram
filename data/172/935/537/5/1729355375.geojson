American popular culture has long influenced contemporary hairstyles in Africa with named styles such as “Boeing” and “Ford.” Female hairstylists often hang several signs depicting dozens of different braided hairstyles for clients to consider with clever titles including “Sweet Banana,” “Top Secret,” and “Mother Clear.” A number of these homey establishments double as places to gather and socialize while offering additional services, from video game play to phone service, which are also advertised on the hand-painted signs.
