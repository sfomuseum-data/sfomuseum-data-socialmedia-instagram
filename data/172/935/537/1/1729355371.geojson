        "body": "“Les Lointains”, which translates to The Faraway, was first produced by Zuber in 1825. Grisailles, or prints executed in predominately gray hues, were created for consumers who wanted a subtler effect in a room. In most instances, they were less expensive than full-color papers. Even so, grisaille papers capture the smallest details, such as veining on a leaf, as precisely as woodblock printing with opaque colors allows. Each detail requires a separate woodblock, and eleven colors are used to create “Les Lointains”. This version also includes yellow hues. In addition to this shade, “Les Lointains” is offered in a green tone as well as a grisaille with colored flowers sprinkled in the foreground.
