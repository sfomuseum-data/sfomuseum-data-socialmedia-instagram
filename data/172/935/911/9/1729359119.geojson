        "body": "Kanji, or Japanese character writing, is based on Chinese script and shares many meanings and definitions. Officially published in the Jōyō Kanji, around 2,000 Chinese-based characters are listed for use in conjunction with a distinct, Japanese kana alphabet. In 1915, Japanese printer and inventor Kyota Sugimoto (1882–1972) patented a typewriter that printed in both Chinese and Japanese. Manufactured by the Nippon Typewriter Company, the machine featured a large, sliding tray with room for 2,450 individual type-slugs. A moving carriage assembly mounted over the tray contained the typing mechanism. To operate, the typist positioned the tray and carriage along an x–y axis to select a type-slug, and depressed a button to retrieve, ink, and print.  Typewriter courtesy of Thomas S. Mullaney. Learn more about the typewriter in our exhibition, \"The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing\", post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Thetypewriter",
