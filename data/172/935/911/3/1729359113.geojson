Worn from 1968 to 1970, the all-season outfit came in Hawaiian Sunset and Maliblue with a Miami Sands stripe. Two optional dresses were also made in Miami Sands with a Hawaiian Sunset or Maliblue stripe, along with a tri-color “jet-a-long” version worn only in flight. \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum until September 10th. http://bit.ly/FashionInFlight1",
