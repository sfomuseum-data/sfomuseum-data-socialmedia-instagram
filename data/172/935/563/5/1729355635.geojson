        "body": "“Terra-Techne“ consists of six suspended “tectonic plates,” each representing a different continent. From the departures level, passengers look up to see multiple iconic California landscape suspended from the underside of each continent. From the mezzanine level, the viewer looks down on a different visual narrative; each continent is topped with a terra cotta “circuit board.” Each circuit board depicts a different design in the evolution of the silicon chip. The artwork is as a monument to technological innovation and organic connectivity. In this inverted landscape, technology replaces the root network of the plant, symbolically becoming the source of growth and connectivity in the digital age.  See “Terra-Techne” by Liz Glynn, pre-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2uav88A",
