        "body": "Born in Bergamo, Italy in 1606, painter Viviano Codazzi reached Naples by the 1620s, where he demonstrated remarkable skill with \"quadratura\"—architectural perspective. Codazzi pursued an illusionistic realism, employing his skills of perspective, architectural rendering, and strong lighting to create a picture of a very real place, even if the viewpoint was impossible and the details inaccurate. Codazzi’s body of work largely consists of medium-size architectural paintings. This large, impressive picture of the Colosseum is characteristic of the painter’s mature work of the 1650s. The highly realized figure group is by Michelangelo Cerquozzi (1602–60), with whom Codazzi collaborated on many pictures.",
