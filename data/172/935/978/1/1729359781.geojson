        "body": "With his selection for the Artist In Residence Program at Recology San Francisco in 2014, Jamil Hellu was granted access to discarded items designated for a landfill or transfer station. \"Shopping Carts\" presents selections from Hellu’s series of assemblages—compositions formed by organizing objects of similar types, shapes, and colors. This manufactured detritus is contrasted sharply against colorful backdrops that reinforce the unity of Hellu’s assemblages with sly reference to the slick presentation of commercial advertisements. His images encourage the viewer to reflect on the relationship between his or her own identity and the economic system in which we all participate.",
