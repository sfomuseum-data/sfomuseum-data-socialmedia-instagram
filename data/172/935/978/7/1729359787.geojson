Next year this Empire of the West will add to the attractions that draw thousands of travelers each year, a Fair that will express the charm and glamour not only of this region but of the nations of the Pacific. The Orient, South Seas, Antipodes, and the Latin Americas are joining us in a vast Pageant of the Pacific to be shown on 400-acre Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. These countries are building with us a Fair that will dramatize the scenery, culture, and recreation of the world’s most glamorous nations. In 1939 the Golden Gate International Exposition will be ready, so that you, traveling through the Western Wonderland, may make your destination the Treasure Island that will hold for you the romantic story of the western world.” Leland W.
