        "body": "“I ask for the movement to continue, for the movement to grow, because last week I got a phone call from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and my election gave somebody else, one more person, hope. And after all, that's what this is all about. It's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power — it's about giving those young people out there in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias, hope. You gotta give them hope.“ Harvey Bernard Milk (1930–78) was a visionary human rights leader, a groundbreaking political luminary, and a seminal figure of the LGBTQ rights movement. Due to his high public profile as the first openly gay elected official in California, Milk attracted a torrent of hate mail, including threats on his life. In a chilling forecast, Milk recorded a living will on November 18, 1978, proclaiming, “If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.” Photo by Daniel Nicoletta  See “Harvey Milk: Messenger of Hope” on display post-security in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/HarveyMilkExhibition",
