        "body": "China Airlines, the flag carrier of Taiwan, was founded on December 12, 1959, by retired Chinese Air Force officers. During the airline's modest beginning, it only had 26 employees and 2 PBY-5A Catalina amphibians. By 1962, the company had a round-the-island route operated by Douglas DC-3s and Curtiss C-46 Commandos. Transpacific service to San Francisco began in 1970 with the acquisition of the Boeing 707 jetliner. Have you ever flown on China Airlines?  Image: China Airlines postcard, Boeing 707, 1970s. Mark F.
