        "body": "Joyce Hsu is a Bay Area artist best known for her mechanized creatures that inhabit a fantasy world of the artist’s creation. “Namoo” is a Korean word that implies nature. The title of this artwork suggests that the airport fuses science, nature, and imagination to become the transit home for all travelers. The graphic background is a stylized aerial view of SFO’s runways and terminals. The flowers and insects are reminiscent of model airplanes coming in for a landing.  See \"Namoo House\" by Joyce Hsu on display, post-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/2qOU4ij",
