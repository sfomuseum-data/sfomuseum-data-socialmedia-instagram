        "body": "An old maritime shipboard tradition was to celebrate crewmembers' and passengers' first passages over the equator or the international dateline. Like many maritime traditions, it was adopted by the aviation industry. On transoceanic flights, certificates were given out to passengers commemorating a crossing of the equator. We have several in our collection, and here is one example which reads: \"King Neptune Order of the equatorial air voyagers Known all men by these presents That John M. Burnard Of San Francisco. California. U.S.A. Having this gallantly crossed our equator in a skyship now becomes a freeman of the air and all rights, benefits and perquisites reserved for those who cross between the hemispheres in airliners are hereby graciously bestowed. All ye powers and dominions subject to his most puissant majesty Neptune take note.\" Image:  Qantas Airways souvenir certificate, equator crossing, 1964. Gift of John M. Burnard. 2004.093.015",
