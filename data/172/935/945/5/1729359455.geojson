Featured on a variety of airline materials to promote San Francisco, this large orange bridge is the iconic landmark for the city by the bay. Did you know that the Golden Gate Bridge is not named for its orange color but for the strait it crosses, the Golden Gate strait? The bridge is painted International Orange color to provide enhanced visibility for passing ships.  Image: David Klein,  TWA (Trans World Airlines) poster, San Francisco, c. 1959.
