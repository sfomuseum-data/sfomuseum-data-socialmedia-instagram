The format of Peephole Cinema harkens back to Thomas Edison’s early motion picture exhibition device, the kinetoscope, designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time. As advances in cinema proliferated through the 20th century, movie theatres popped up all over the country and viewing quickly evolved into a social experience. In many ways, our contemporary experience of technology and entertainment in particular, has reverted back to the solo experience: the individual and their digital device. Peephole Cinema invites elements of both the old and the new, the shared experience and the solitary.
