        "body": "When McDonnell Douglas began to develop their widebody jetliner in the late 1960s, they endeavored to create an airliner that would operate in areas not served by the 747. The DC-10 was initially designed to be operated on transcontinental or regional routes (although later variants came with enhanced, transoceanic range) with fewer passengers than the 747. It was also intended to operate at airports not suitable for the 747. It would thus broaden the widebody market to more airlines and a greater proportion of the traveling public. McDonnell Douglas promoted the DC-10 as the widebody airliner for the entire family in a promotional poster by artist George Akimoto (1922–2010). “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
