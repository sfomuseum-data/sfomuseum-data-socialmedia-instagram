        "body": "In response to the Victorians’ love of collecting and eclectic display, furniture firms also produced smaller, shorter stands to display all manner of items—from plants, vases, and candleholders to smoking paraphernalia. Such stands might grace drawing rooms, hallways, and parlors. Plant stands often have a rim encircling their tops. Kilian Brothers produced a variety of plant stands with lively decorative details. This ebonized pedestal features polychrome painted decoration and gilding. Greek fretwork adorns the bottom of the plant stand while winged cherubs grace either side; gold chains drape from their feet. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
