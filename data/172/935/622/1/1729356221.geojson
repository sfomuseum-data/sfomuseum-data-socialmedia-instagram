The 1:10 model features dozens of people in various positions passing time on their flight, from knitting to reading magazines to eating meals. The model is from the late 1950s and has areas of loss and surface dirt. Several missing parts, such as feet, hands, and armrests, were cast in plaster from intact components and are carefully being shaped and finished, and will eventually be painted to completely blend in.
