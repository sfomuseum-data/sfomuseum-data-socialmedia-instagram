        "body": "Leonardo Drew’s work is a multi-layered installation spanning three walls. Comprised of hundreds of small sculptural components to create a massive galaxy, the installation is a cosmos whose collective parts can be identified as letters of an alphabet that create a narrative. The elements comprising the whole are remnants of past artworks, a recycling effort that is integral to Drew’s desire to never let anything go to waste. When juxtaposed in a new setting, this visual alphabet creates new words and new meanings.  The installation at San Francisco International Airport speaks to an enormous cross-section of people, carrying with them a multitude of life experiences and cultures.  See “Number 69S” by Leonardo Drew, on display, post security in Terminal 1. ",
