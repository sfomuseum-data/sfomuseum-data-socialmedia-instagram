        "body": "In the 1930s, irons were redesigned with clean, curved housings reminiscent of streamlined train cars. Perhaps the most streamlined design to enter the market was the 1941 Petipoint iron, designed by Clifford Brooks Stevens (1911–1995) and Edward P. Schreyer (1886–1980) with a pointed teardrop shape, wing-like projections, and a curved handle with speed lines. \"Streamlines: Air Age Aesthetics for Industrial Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Streamlines",
