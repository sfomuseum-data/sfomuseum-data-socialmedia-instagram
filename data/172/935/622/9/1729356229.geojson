Capable of traveling at 80 miles an hour, the airship could stay aloft for up to 100 hours nonstop with up to 24 passengers on board. On its Tokyo to Los Angeles leg, the Graf Zeppelin flew over San Francisco, completing the first non-stop transpacific air crossing. Fun Fact: Lady Grace Drummond-Hay, an English journalist, was the only woman among sixty passengers and crew on the Graf Zeppelin during this trip, making her the first woman to circumnavigate the globe by air.
