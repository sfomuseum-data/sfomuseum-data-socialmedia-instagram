Operated by TWA (Trans World Airlines), this Boeing 707 flight officially launched SFO into the jet age. The speed of commercial jet aircraft enabled airlines to offer customers dramatically reduced flying times. It was the capacity and efficiency of the jets, however, that dramatically reduced per-passenger costs. This in turn spurred a wave of economy fare programs. Have you ever flown on a Boeing 707?
