        "body": "Rod Kelly’s pair of Carp vases, completed in 1987 for Garrard and Company, was the artist’s first major commercial commission. For the source material of his design, Kelly purchased two rainbow trout, froze them into contorted, curved forms, and then rendered a series of sketches. The fish are surrounded by a plant motif based on species of native grasses Kelly collected along Hampshire’s River Itchen in South East England. Kelly’s final illustration and design took a matter of days, while the chasing was accomplished over five weeks at a rate of approximately one square inch each hour.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
