        "body": "The Douglas DC-3 was arguably the most significant commercial airliner introduced before World War II. Conceived by Arthur Raymond, the DC-3 incorporated numerous advancements, including a strong, highly streamlined, all-aluminum, semi-monocoque fuselage, and an ingenious modular, high-aspect-ratio, ultra-strong, low-drag wing design. The aircraft proved aerodynamically superior, highly reliable, easy to maintain, and brought carriers their first profits from passenger service. More than four hundred were initially ordered by major airlines beginning in 1937. By 1940, nearly three million passengers had flown in DC-3s, and they collectively logged over one hundred million miles. By the end of production, over ten thousand commercial and military transport versions had been built.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
