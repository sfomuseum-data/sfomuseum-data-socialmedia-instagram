        "body": "In 1942, twenty-one-year-old Esther Bubley (1921–98), a recent graduate from the photography program at the Minneapolis School of Art (now Minneapolis College of Art and Design), accepted a position with the Office of War Information (OWI) in Washington, D.C., to work as a darkroom lab technician. At work, Bubley formed friendships with many of the program’s photographers, who soon recognized her talents and ambition as a photographer. Before long, Roy Stryker, the program’s director, offered her a position working in the field. In 1943, Stryker sent Bubley on a six-week bus trip to document the country’s transition between the Great Depression and World War II. Bubley’s unassuming demeanor and inclination for photographing ordinary people and daily life paired well with the close quarters of bus travel. On assignment, she rode crowded buses throughout the country, using her square format Rolleiflex camera to capture intimate and empathetic images of bus-riders on routes throughout the Midwest and southern United States.  See \"1943 Bus Story\" by Esther Bubley, on display, pre- security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/2fmH8JG",
