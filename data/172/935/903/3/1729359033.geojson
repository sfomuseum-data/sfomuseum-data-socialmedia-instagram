        "body": "This is your last week to see \"The Years Fly By: Airline Calendars from the Collection!\" The promotional airline calendar is an enduring form of airline ephemera that is a marriage of the airlines’ brand identity with an object of daily utility in the home or office. The use of the calendar as a promotional tool for the airlines was forged in the 1930s and ‘40s and became common following World War II. Airlines invested considerable care and attention in making calendars that were visually stunning examples of graphic design. Such calendars promised rapid, comfortable travel to cities worldwide with scenes of the airline’s exciting destinations. \"The Years Fly By: Airline Calendars\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/YearsFlyBy",
