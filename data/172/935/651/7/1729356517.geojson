In examining the landscape of these three states, Cheung hopes to focus on the involvement of the nineteenth-century Chinese migrant workers whose contributions to the transcontinental railroad made the transcontinental connection possible. In building this rail road, the workers helped shape the physical and social landscape of the American West.
