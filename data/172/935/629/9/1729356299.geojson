        "body": "One of the first uses of aluminum helicopter rotor blades was in the Hiller XH-44 “Hiller-copter”, designed and built by Stanley Hiller, Jr. (1924–2006) in 1944 at the age of nineteen. Prior helicopter rotor blade designs were constructed primarily of wood and had a slight amount of flexibility. The XH-44 featured two rigid, counter-rotating rotor blades designed to cancel out the torque caused by a single main rotor, which in turn eliminated the need for a tail rotor to counteract the spinning of the helicopter in the opposite direction from the rotor. They required the rigidity of aluminum in order to prevent contact at high revolutions, potentially causing severe damage to both. By the 1960s, most helicopter rotors were made out of aluminum, often combined with other materials. In recent decades, helicopter rotors have been constructed of composite materials. \"Aluminum: The Miracle Metal of Aviation\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AviationAluminum",
