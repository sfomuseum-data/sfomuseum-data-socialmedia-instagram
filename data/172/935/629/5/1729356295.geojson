        "body": "When you say “bug” to entomologists, they assume you mean a true bug—an insect in the order Hemiptera. This group includes stink bugs, kissing bugs, water striders, cicadas, aphids, and many more. They all have stiff, beak-like mouthparts, like a hypodermic needle, that can pierce through plant tissue or other insects’ exoskeletons. By injecting saliva with digestive enzymes into their food, they are able to suck the fluids out with their straw-like mouthparts. Many true bugs are aquatic as both nymphs and adults.  See “The Intriguing World of Insects” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/IntriguingInsects",
