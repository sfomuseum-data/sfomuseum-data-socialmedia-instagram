Farzaneh, who left Iran for the United States during the Arab Spring of 2010–12, communicates the anxiety, alienation, and complex range of emotions shared with other immigrants in her beautifully composed, hand-drawn animation. See \"Scent of Geranium\" and three other shorts by Hannah Jacobs, Isabel Morales Bondy, and Heather Condo, now playing in the Video Arts screening room located pre-security in the International Terminal Departures Lobby. http://bit.ly/VideoArts",
