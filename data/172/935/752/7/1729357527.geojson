        "body": "From the 1920s to the 1940s, radio programs that featured live musical performances were far more numerous than broadcasts of recorded music. Radio stations employed professional musicians, maintained house orchestras, and broadcast classical symphonies. Vocalists such as Bing Crosby (1903â€“77) were standard performers on the airwaves. Crosby gained fame on live radio and by the late 1940s, the singer hosted a pre-recorded radio show and marketed a radio-phonograph combo for Philco. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
