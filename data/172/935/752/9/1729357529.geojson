        "body": "In 1958, sociologist turned real estate developer Nathan K. Mendelsohn purchased 82,000 acres of land in the Mojave Desert with the intent of master-planning California's next great metropolis. In his series, California City, California, photographer Noritaka Minami draws focus on California City as it exists today. Employing an aerial perspective, Minami documents the vast scale and ambition of the project in a high-key aesthetic that reflects the dry environment below. Seen from above, the cityâ€™s seemingly endless system of roads takes on the appearance of blueprints or planning documents, recalling the potential of Mendelsohn's original design and inciting visions of how this land may be developed in coming years. \"California City, California\" by Noritaka Minami is on display pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2pJLqjm",
