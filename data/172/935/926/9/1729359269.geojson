The Visual Arts department at Lick-Wilmerding High School designs courses that nurture perception, thinking, and expression.  The artwork on display includes acrylic painting, ink on paper, collage, and photography. Drawing and painting students worked collaboratively to produce stylized acrylic paintings of iconic San Francisco landmarks. Students enrolled in a contemporary media course focused on the complexities of portraiture and created expressive self-portrait collages. Photography students created complex images of the urban landscape using traditional large-format film cameras. Students studying architectural design produced drawings for a music hub to be submitted to a competition sponsored by the Architectural Foundation of San Francisco.  See “Landmarks, Portraits, and Architecture” by students from Lick-Wilmerding High School, pre-security, on the arrivals level of Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2vzVuwg",
