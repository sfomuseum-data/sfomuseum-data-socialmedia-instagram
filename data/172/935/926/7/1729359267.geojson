        "body": "Mario Armond Zamparelli created this highly original outfit for Hughes Airwest in 1972 to fulfill his vision of an airline uniform that he wanted “revved-up with a classic boldness in beautiful shapes streaming like light over the body.” The Sundance Yellow polyester stretch knit suit has a tightly contoured, full-zipper jacket that can be closed to the neck or opened to create a fold-down collar. The above-the-knee princess dress has a jewel collar and double –front, pleated skirt. The outfit included matching shoes or knee-high boots in crinkle leatherette. Zamparelli’s uniform collection was issued until 1977. \"#FashionInFlight: A Photo Album\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/FIFPhotos  Image: Hughes Airwest hostesses in uniforms by Mario Armond Zamparelli, c. 1972.
