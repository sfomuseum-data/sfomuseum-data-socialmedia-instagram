        "body": "Our online database contains a selection of ticket jackets from our collection, such as this gem from PSA. Beginning in the 1930s, airline tickets consisted of long, rectangular strips of paper, or coupons, for each leg of a flight. Tickets usually came in a jacket that incorporated the name and logo of the carrier, along with aircraft and service promotions. A flight packet with information about the airline, the flight, and the destination was often included. http://bit.ly/2h0zFQe  Image: Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) ticket jacket, c. 1972.
