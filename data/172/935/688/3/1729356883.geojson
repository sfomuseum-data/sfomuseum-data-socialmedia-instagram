        "body": "In his ongoing series, “Of Heaven and Earth”, artist David Shannon-Lier produces large-scale photographs that consider the landscape on both a human and cosmic scale. Building site-specific installations in the landscape, Shannon-Lier intervenes with the terrain in front of his camera to create visual interactions—revealed through long-exposure photographs—between the earth and the celestial bodies above it. He stacks rocks, manipulates branches, and uses other found materials to make marks that will interact with or extend the arc of the chosen astronomical object. Photographed with a large format film camera and using exposure times often in excess of five hours, Shannon-Lier’s temporary installations come to life, producing images that are both poignant and thought-provoking. “Of Heaven and Earth” by artist David Shannon-Lier is on display, pre-security, in Terminal 3. https://www.flysfo.com/museum/exhibitions/david-shannon-lier-heaven-and-earth",
