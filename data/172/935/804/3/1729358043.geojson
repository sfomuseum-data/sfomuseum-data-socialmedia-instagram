        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1962, the Vickers VC10 took off on its maiden flight. The VC10 was similar in size and capacity to the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. It was developed for transoceanic routes as well as to operate from short runway airports, particularly in Africa. The VC10 was powered by four engines mounted in tandem on each side of the fuselage at the tail, which allowed safer operation on rough runways, while also reducing noise levels inside the cabin during flights. The aircraft could comfortably carry just over 150 passengers and had a nonstop range suitable for most transatlantic routes. It was one of the fastest subsonic jetliners produced and, under the operation of BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation) and British Airways, achieved the shortest average transatlantic flight time between London and New York.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
