        "body": "Transistors are far smaller than vacuum tubes and do not require periodic replacement. Initially too costly for most products, audio transistors found their first use in hearing aids. In 1954, Texas Instruments partnered with Industrial Development Engineering Associates (IDEA) and created the first transistorized radio. Marketed as the Regency TR-1, it featured a built-in speaker and debuted just in time for the holiday season. In 1957, Sony marketed their first pocket-sized radio, the TR-63, followed by the popular TR-510 in 1961. Japanese transistor radios were designed for the American market, and sales quickly outpaced heavier and more-expensive examples made in the United States. Do you own any transistor radios? \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
