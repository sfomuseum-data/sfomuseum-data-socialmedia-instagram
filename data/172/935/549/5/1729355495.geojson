        "body": "#Onthisday in 1969, the first Concorde took off on its maiden flight departing from Toulouse, France. Developed as a joint endeavor between the governments of Great Britain and France, the aircraft that made this flight, Concorde 001, was built in France. The United Statesâ€™ Congress initially banned Concorde service to the United States because of noise pollution concerns, but eventually allowed service to Washington Dulles International Airport. A supersonic transatlantic flight between Paris and Washington D.C. lasted on average just three and one-half hours at 1,350 miles per hour, faster than the speed of the Earth's rotation. All Concorde SSTs were retired in 2003.  Image: British Aircraft Corporation postcard, Sud Aviation France, Concord 001, c. 1970. Gift of Thomas G. Dragges. 2015.166.0149",
