        "body": "Founded in 1991, Art With Elders (AWE) connects generations by celebrating the wisdom, talents, and creativity of older adults, while utilizing the vast potential of the visual arts as a tool to address the challenges of aging. The program provides two thousand art classes each year for more than four hundred seniors living in long-term care communities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. AWE is distinctive in its program quality; these are not craft activities, but instead focus on technique and skill-building—ranging from color and composition to perspective and background. As part of Art With Elder’s twenty-fifth anniversary, SFO Museum is proud to exhibit the works of nineteen artists working in a variety of mediums including watercolor, acrylic, and oil on canvas.  See more art by Art With Elders, pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2gMpSSk",
