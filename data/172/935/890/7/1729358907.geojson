        "body": "The Corona 3 was a revolutionary portable, first patented as the Standard Folding Typewriter in 1904. This front-stroke machine featured a three-row, double-shift keyboard with a carriage that folded forward for maximum portability. In 1922, Corona even advertised that their typewriters were so portable, you could type up a letter anywhere, even in a public shower.  Learn more about the typewriter in \"The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Thetypewriter",
