        "body": "Italian artist Luca Tombolini travels the globe in search of isolated locations and obscure landscapes. Working with a large format film camera, Tombolini renders each scene in exquisite detail and produces his images as large format prints. In his series, “Vistas Paradossales”, Tombolini embraces the use of in-camera multiple-exposure and long-exposure techniques to create shadowy nocturnal images that further distort time and place in these already surreal and remote locations.  See “Vistas Paradossales” by Luca Tombolini on display, pre-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2vGg4Rp",
