Everyone paid the same fare but got a 10% discount for round trip tickets. Behind the counter at the right is Steve Stimpson, United’s district manager who hired Ellen Church, world’s first female flight attendant. Do you remember purchasing flight tickets at a ticket office?  Image: United Air Lines San Francisco ticket office, c. 1933. Gift of United Airlines Archives. 1999.047.239",
