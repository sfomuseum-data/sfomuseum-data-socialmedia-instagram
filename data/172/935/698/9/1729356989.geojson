Located in San Francisco Bay, Treasure Island was constructed for the 1939–40 San Francisco World’s Fair called the Golden Gate International Exposition.  Pan Am moved its base from Alameda to Treasure Island where the Fair’s Administration Building served as the airline’s terminal, topped with an observation tower for air traffic control. Two hangars behind the building housed Pan Am’s trans-Pacific operations; one with an overhead platform where paying spectators watched maintenance crews servicing the famous flying boats.
