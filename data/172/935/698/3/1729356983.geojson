        "body": "The 1950s were the golden age of space-themed toys. Japanese manufacturers pioneered the robot toy craze in the late 1940s with Atomic Robot Man, a wind-up, tin lithograph toy that walked on its own. Nomura followed suit in the mid-1950s with a series of battery-operated robots including Zoomer, which featured a dramatically slow walking action and expressionless, glowing red eyes. Robert the Robot was the first plastic toy robot manufactured in the United States. Made from Alathon, a molded, thermoplastic developed by the DuPont Company, Robert the Robot was mechanically operated by a driveshaft cable and remote control. A small, windup record player hidden inside the toy enabled Robert to repeat the phrase, “I am Robert the Robot, the mechanical man, drive me, steer me, wherever you can.” \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
