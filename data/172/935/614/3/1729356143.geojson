        "body": "The Douglas DC-6 was initially conceived of as a military transport, but with the end of World War II, the design was changed to a civilian airliner, primarily in an effort to compete with the Lockheed Constellation. It was fundamentally an updated, enlarged, and pressurized DC-4. Introduced by United Air Lines and American Airlines in 1946, it was the first new American-designed airliner to operate during the postwar years.  The passenger versions featured luxuriously appointed cabin interiors with a lounge in the tail section. One of the most economical large propliners to operate during the postwar period, over 700 were eventually built and added to airline fleets worldwide. “American Airliner Cockpits, 1925–1975” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library, located in the International Terminal.
