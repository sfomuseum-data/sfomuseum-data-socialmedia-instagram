Exhibition furniture and mounts are fabricated, approved, dismantled, and packed in a separate facility before being transported to the terminals and installed in their specific case. Here, our team has done the final object staging and has checked the mounts before everything is packed up to be transported into the terminal. Stay tuned for more behind the scenes glimpses at what goes on at SFO Museum",
