The event drew hundreds of thousands of visitors.  As SFO had reached two million annual passengers by 1952, this new facility could accommodate several million additional passengers. The upper level was for departures and the lower level was for arrivals, each with its own roadway. A spacious restaurant named the International Room provided panoramic views of the airfield. Later called the Central Terminal, the building has been modified several times over the years. It is now named Terminal 2 and is still part of SFO.
