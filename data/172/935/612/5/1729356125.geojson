        "body": "During the 1870s, collecting antiques and objets d’art became a national pastime. Before the mid-nineteenth century, antique collecting tended to be reserved for affluent antiquarians collecting ancient and rare items. By the late nineteenth century, enthusiasts began collecting more commonplace antiques to artfully arrange in their homes as well as exotic pieces from Asian and Near Eastern cultures. As a result, pedestals were used to display sculpture and all manner of novel collectible treasures. Many rooms in late-nineteenth-century homes were furnished in a variety of styles, which further encouraged collectors to consider a wide range of assorted antiques and objets d’art. Home decorating periodicals offered extensive advice on how to identify, purchase, and display antiques and collectibles. In 1886 the term “antique dealer” first appeared in London trade directories. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
