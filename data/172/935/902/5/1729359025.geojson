        "body": "Featured in our exhibition on the history of the design and use of typewriters is a \"The Good Companion Model T\" made by The Imperial Typewriter Co., Ltd. which once belonged to John Lennon. “I used to go ‘round to Aunt Mimi’s house and John would be at the typewriter, which was fairly unusual in Liverpool. None of my mates even knew what a typewriter was. Well, they knew what one was, but they didn't have one. Nobody had a typewriter…Then we'd go up to John’s room and we'd sit on the bed and play records, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry. It’s a wonderful memory.” —Paul McCartney  Typewriter courtesy of Steve Soboroff.
