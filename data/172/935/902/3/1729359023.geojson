        "body": "Located north of San Cristóbal de Las Casas in Los Altos de Chiapas, San Andrés Larráinzar is home to a vibrant community of weavers. For centuries, Tzotzil-speaking women in San Andrés have woven huipiles on backstrap looms in a similar manner to their ancestors of the Classic Maya Period (300–900CE). The art of Mayan backstrap weaving and its associated symbols and designs are traditionally passed down through generations of women in Chiapas. This transfer of knowledge does not always occur from mother to daughter. Some artisans, including Magdalena López López, learned their craft from grandmothers and other women in their community. Like many weavers, she keeps small muestra weaving samples to reference designs and symbols.
