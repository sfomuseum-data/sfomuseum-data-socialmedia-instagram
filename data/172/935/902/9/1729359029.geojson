        "body": "On October 1, 1988, the newly reformed and privatized airline Aeromexico commenced operations. The airline was originally founded in 1934 as Aeronaves de Mexico by Antonio Díaz Lombardo. During the 1970s, it was nationalized. However, by the 1988, the carrier was declared bankrupt and a new privatized parent company, Aerovías de México, S.A. de C.V., was formed. Aeromexico is currently the flag carrier of Mexico, and based in Mexico City. The airline flies to over 100 cities world wide. Their mascot is the Eagle Knight and is deeply rooted in Mexico's ancient indigenous cultural heritage. Have you ever flown on Aeromexico?  Image: AeroMexico timetable, 1990.
