        "body": "The Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra was a twin-engine, low-wing monoplane with a clean, aerodynamic fuselage and a twin tail. It was developed in response to criticism from airlines that the earlier Model 10 Electra was too small. The Model 14 had more powerful engines than the Model 10, could carry two more passengers, and featured Fowler flaps on the wings that enabled it to glide at low speed on the approach to landings. More than two hundred were built in the United States and under license in Japan. They were operated by airlines worldwide. In 1938, a modified version was flown by Howard Hughes and a crew of four to circumnavigate the northern hemisphere, covering 23,804 miles in three days and nineteen hours, a world record.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
