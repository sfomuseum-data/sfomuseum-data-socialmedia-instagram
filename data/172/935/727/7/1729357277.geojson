        "body": "In her series, Air/Plains, artist Millee Tibbs revisits the ever-familiar image of the setting sun. During the course of two weeks working in the Great Plains region of central Nebraska, Tibbs photographed the sun each evening as it disappeared over the horizon. Back in the studio, she produced the images as pigment prints, folded them into common paper airplane designs, and re-photographed the objects. The title of the series refers to the content of the image—the sky and earth—and also to the object into which the photograph has been folded. The resulting images hold the illusionistic space of the landscape while documenting the folding, creasing, and scoring that give them form. In this way, Tibbs draws attention to the photograph as object and meditates on our tendencies to often mistake a picture for the thing itself. \"Air/Plains\" by Millee Tibbs is on display, post-security on the departures level of Terminal 1. http://ow.ly/IjFG50jS9CR",
