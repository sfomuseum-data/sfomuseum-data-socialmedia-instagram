        "body": "The Universal Airlines Corporation was founded in July 1928. A short-lived airline that primarily operated in the Midwest, it acquired several different small airlines in the United States before being acquired itself by Aviation Corporation in 1929. The most notable of these acquisitions was the first incarnation of Braniff Air Lines, started by Paul and Tom Braniff. The brothers would go on to form Braniff Airways in 1930, renamed Braniff International in 1948. This brochure advertises the new era of commercial aviation, as people began to adopt air travel as a mode of transportation.  Image: Universal Air Lines, Fokker F.10 brochure, 1929.
