        "body": "Although best known for its pottery department, the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College was also acclaimed for its embroidery department, which opened in 1902. Unlike pottery, needlework had long been an entirely feminine craft. Most women learned how to do some form of needlework at an early age from their mothers. In pottery, men commonly shaped the pieces while women did the decorating. Needleworkers on the other hand, were responsible for their embroideries from start to finish. Artisans crafted designs for textiles in a similar fashion to ceramics, with designs first sketched in pencil and then rendered in watercolor. A variety of indigenous flora served as a major source of inspiration. Pieces of Newcomb embroidery, such as this tree panel, are extremely rare today.  Embroidery courtesy of Dianne Ayres \u0026 Tim Hanson - Arts \u0026 Crafts Period Textiles.
