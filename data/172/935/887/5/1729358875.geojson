        "body": "In his ongoing series, \"El Muqui\", Paccarik Orue draws focus on Cerro de Pasco, a historical mining city located fourteen thousand feet above sea level in the Peruvian Andes. The city of eighty thousand residents is built upon a wealth of mineral deposits—the Peruvian government’s primary export. Cerro de Pasco encircles El Tajo, an open-pit zinc and lead mine that slowly expands outwards, engulfing the four-hundred-year-old city and polluting its water supply. Since 2012, Orue has travelled back and forth between the Bay Area and Cerro De Pasco, documenting the city, which has been slated for relocation due to the continued expansion of the mine. Working with a medium format Hasselblad camera, Orue narrates a story of daily lives and environmental concerns while focusing on the city’s vibrant cultural traditions and local folklore.  See \"El Muqui\" by Paccarik Orue, on display,  post-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2iOouzr",
