Likely made for the export market, these distinctive turquoise cats are the products of chemical reactions between alkaline bases and copper oxide additives that occur during kiln-firing. What do you think of these cats?  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons . . .",
