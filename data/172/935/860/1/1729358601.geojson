        "body": "Photography has been central to advancing scientific discovery and exploration since its invention in the 1820s. Drawing inspiration from the long-standing intersection between photography and science, contemporary artist Caleb Charland creates large-scale photographs that meditate on the fundamental forces of nature. The series title, Back to Light, speaks to Charland's fascination with the transfer of energy and the many forms it can take. In this series, Charland expands upon a classic grade-school science experiment-the potato battery. Working on a much larger scale than most classroom experiments, Charland creates sculptural installations that generate enough power to illuminate long-exposure photographs made in total darkness.  See \"Back to Light\" by Caleb Charland located pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2n6SzcN",
