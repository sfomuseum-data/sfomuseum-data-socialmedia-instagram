        "body": "During the late Edo period (1615-1868), Japanese artisans began making maneki neko or beckoning cat figurines, which have an upraised paw intending to draw people forth into businesses and homes. Maneki neko are a type of engimono or auspicious object believed to have the power to fulfill wishes for good fortune, prosperity, and happiness. By the end of the Meiji period (1868-1912), numerous potteries across the country offered maneki neko in ceramic and plaster, including the celebrated Seto and Kutani porcelain kilns. Today, these lucky cats are rendered in a range of contemporary designs-some even have heads that bow and arms that wave electronically. This exhibition features a variety of traditional maneki neko from Japan's many kilns.  This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum. \"Maneki Neko: Japanese Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
