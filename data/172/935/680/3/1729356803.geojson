        "body": "The atomic age permeated American culture throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s, influencing literature, film, television, and consumer goods. Anxiety surrounding atomic testing and fallout became more prevalent, and as tensions rose between the United States and the Soviet Union, the threat of nuclear war loomed in the public mind. In 1950, the federal government created the Civil Defense Administration to organize response personnel and to educate the public about the nuclear threat. To counteract widespread fear, atomic energy was promoted as a safe and efficient source of power. In 1953, president Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890â€“1969) addressed the United Nations, warning of the consequences of atomic development and calling for peaceful nuclear research. Families set aside rations and constructed fallout shelters, and by the end of the decade the first nuclear power plants began service. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
