        "body": "Without aluminum, the rapid advancement of aviation in the twentieth century would have been impossible. The 1903 Wright Flyer would not have flown without an aluminum engine, rigid airships would not have ascended, and without extensive use of the metal in constructing airframes, the airplane would not have been the world-changing wonder it became. Aluminumâ€™s lightness, strength, malleability, and durability was unmatched by any other material at the time. Easily formed into a wide range of shapes, and combined with other metallic elements to form alloys, aluminum continues to have desirable qualities for many aeronautical applications. This new exhibition presents a survey of the uses of aluminum in aviation over the last century.  See \"Aluminum: The Miracle Metal of Aviation\" on display pre-security in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AviationAluminum",
