        "body": "The Sikorsky S-42 was developed to meet the requirements of Pan American Airways’ president Juan T. Trippe for a large, long-range, trans-oceanic flying boat. Designed by Igor Sikorsky, with input from Charles Lindbergh, it could carry thirty-two passengers up to 1,200 miles. The Brazilian Clipper NC-822M was the first to enter service in 1934. It primarily flew Pan American’s Latin American routes. A later version, the S-42B, was equipped with more powerful engines and had extended range. S-42 types conducted route survey flights in the Pacific and North Atlantic, along with serving many of the airline’s routes, including the Manila–Hong Kong leg of transpacific service to China in the late 1930s.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
