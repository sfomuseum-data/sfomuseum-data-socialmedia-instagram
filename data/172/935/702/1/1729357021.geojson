        "body": "Located on the North Shore of O‘ahu, Pipeline produces some of the world’s most powerful hollow waves. Pipeline is best known for the short and spectacular “tube rides” that envelop surfers within the curl of the wave before they are expelled in a dramatic burst of water and mist. Waves that exceed ten feet in height break in water that is only six feet above a black-lava reef, making wipeouts extremely hazardous. Surfer-shaper Gerry Lopez (b. 1948) redefined tube riding at Pipeline. Born in Hawai‘i and raised in Honolulu, Lopez spent much of his youth surfing at Waikīkī. By the early 1970s, Lopez rode Pipeline with an unmatched, fluid style that made surfing one of the world’s most dangerous breaks appear Zen-like. \"Reflections in Wood — Surfboards and Shapers\" exhibition is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/SurfboardsAndShapers",
