        "body": "In 1957, BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation) introduced the long-delayed, turboprop Britannia, developed and produced by the Bristol Aircraft Company of Filton, England. Initially, the fast, large-capacity, long-range airliner was operated on the airline’s London–New York route. Two years later, BOAC inaugurated the its first regular round-the-world service via San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. Overall, the Britannia performed well, yet it was plagued with engine intake icing problems. BOAC flew the Britannia for several years before replacing it with faster, more economical, long-range turbojets. Many were later sold to smaller carriers such as Eagle Airways, where the Britannia continued in operation on trans-oceanic routes. During the early 1960s, the airline, then controlled by the Cunard Steamship Company and called Cunard Eagle Airways, offered Britannia transatlantic service first to Bermuda, and shortly after, to New York. In 1965, after reorganizing as British Eagle International Airways, a Britannia inaugurated the airline’s first transatlantic passenger service between South Africa and South America.
