        "body": "The paper dress was a 1960s pop-cultural phenomenon and fashion fad. Intended to be worn only once or a handful of times, paper dresses were made from a blend of synthetic fibers and paper pulp in colorful prints and graphic art motifs. Invented somewhat unwittingly by the Scott Paper Company in 1966 as a marketing gimmick, they were advertised for $1.25 in two styles of “Paper Caper” dresses. Scott was flooded with more than 500,000 orders, and other companies quickly followed suit with their own paper dresses. Poster Dresses Ltd. created perhaps the most iconic examples of the paper dress. This design was based on a black-and-white, photographic print of a tabby cat by graphic artist Harry Gordon (1930–2007). Advertising on each package suggested that after the dress was worn, it could be cut at the seams and hung as a poster, or sewn along with others into curtains or a bedspread.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
