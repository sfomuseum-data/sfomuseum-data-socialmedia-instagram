        "body": "The sixteenth President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln (1809–65) began serving in March of 1861. He led the country through its bloodiest conflict—the Civil War— successfully preserving the Union and paving the way for the abolition of slavery with the 1862 Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln is well remembered for his powerful, eloquent speeches, none more so than his Gettysburg Address of 1863. His assassination by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth in 1865, at the close of the Civil War, sealed his fate as the country’s greatest presidential martyr. Countless craftsmen memorialized Lincoln in their winsome creations, from carved wooden busts to plaques. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
