        "body": "Described by Fortune magazine in 1936 as “the gaudy brother of somber Bakelite,” Catalin, the trade name for a cast-phenolic plastic made in a variety of brilliant colors, was first used to make smaller items such as bracelets, chess pieces, and buckles. By mixing and matching the bright and lustrous range of Catalin colors, designers including Walter Dorwin Teague (1883–1960) and Norman Bel Geddes (1893–1958) created radio cases that embodied progress and optimism during the Great Depression. Made from the mid-1930s through the late 1940s, Catalin radios are colorful, visually expressive examples of modern styling and industrial design. Now highly sought after by collectors, these radios exhibit influences of Art Deco and combine art and style with functional objects.  Radio courtesy of Jaime Arbona. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
