        "body": "San Francisco had the barest necessities of an airport—an airstrip and an unfinished Administration Building—when it officially dedicated Mills Field #onthisday in 1927. Thirty-seven airplanes, participating in a State Aeronautical Conference, sat on the ground during the brief ceremony and then roared down the dirt airstrip to fly on to Sacramento. Construction of the Administration Building and Hangar No. 1 was completed by September 21.  Image: Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco dedication, 1927.
