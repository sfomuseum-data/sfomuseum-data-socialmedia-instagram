        "body": "The Boeing 307 Stratoliner was the first commercial airliner put in service to have a pressurized cabin. Named the “Stratoliner” for its ability to cruise near the stratosphere, the airliner had a circular cross-section, tear-drop-shaped fuselage to handle the stresses of pressurization. Only ten were produced: one prototype, five for TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air), three for Pan American, and one for Howard Hughes. Launched by TWA in 1940, the airline touted its quietness, speed, and advanced capability of flying above bad weather and turbulence.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
