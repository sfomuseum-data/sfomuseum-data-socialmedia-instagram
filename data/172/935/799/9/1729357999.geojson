Each strip in this colorful artwork corresponds to a landmark, moment, or object that is unique to our beloved city. In creating the artwork, artist Leah Rosenberg explored various neighborhoods sampling colors from her surroundings and asking residents what colors stood out to them. In doing so, her artwork becomes a new kind of map of the city that speaks to how color can help define a place and contribute to the importance of togetherness.  See \"Everywhere a Color\" by Leah Rosenberg, on display, post-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/2KqFkNT",
