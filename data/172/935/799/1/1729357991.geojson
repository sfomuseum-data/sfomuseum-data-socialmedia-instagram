        "body": "This is your last week to see \"American Folk Art\". From the late eighteenth century through the early twentieth century, American folk art flourished. Unlike academic or fine art, folk art typically derives from deeply-rooted community traditions, with master craftspeople developing a local style emulated by others and passed from one generation to the next. Folk art commonly serves both utilitarian and decorative purposes and historically tends to thrive in rural communities. This exhibition presents weathervanes, fraktur, southern stoneware, and wooden canes, alongside more unusual items, such as carved stone books and fraternal-order plaques.  See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
