        "body": "The lap steel guitar developed in Hawai’i in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries and is attributed to an adolescent named Joseph Kekuku (1874–1932). He began playing a regular guitar on his lap and sliding a piece of metal along its strings. By plucking the strings with one hand and changing the pitch of the strings with the use of a metal bar or slide, he created an entirely new sound. Kekuku spent several years perfecting the technique, which his classmates soon learned. The new form of guitar playing quickly spread throughout the islands, transforming island guitar music as well as the music of the continental United States. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
