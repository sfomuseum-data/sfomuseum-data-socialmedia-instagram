On average, middle-class adolescents earned more in allowance per week than many families took in during the Great Depression, and young people became consumers for the first time. Toys and other products were marketed specifically to girls and boys, and kids personalized their rooms with a variety of items. Hula hoops, jump ropes, plastic purses, chewing-gum wrapper chains, and other fads abounded. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
