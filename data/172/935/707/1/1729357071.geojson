        "body": "Tara Coomber hand-raised many of Martyn Pugh’s designs from 1999 to 2004. To acknowledge her work, Pugh engraved the words “Tara Coomber helped make me” in discreet places on several pieces. Coomber’s personal output includes a range of bold and delicate designs, with an emphasis on simplicity of line. The artist’s superb craftsmanship is apparent in her exhibited boxes. Coomber’s Ammonite box, made for a desktop, is quite tactile and brilliantly incorporates a cross-section of a fossil for the ribbed, spiral-formed shell of the ancient sea creature. Among Coomber’s numerous awards are the Assay Office Prize from the British Jewellery Association and a grant from the Goldsmiths’ Company.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
