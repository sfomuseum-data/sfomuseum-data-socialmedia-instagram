Connecting Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Paraguay, and Argentina in the 1930s and 1940s, each country had their own established TACA subsidiary. At its peak in the mid 1940s, TACA served over 16 countries with 235 destinations.  TACA El Salvador is the only airline of the network to survive to the 1950s and is now operating under the Avianca brand as Avianca El Salvador. Did you ever fly on TACA?
