        "body": "For centuries, canes served as compulsory fashion accessories, similar to hats. Both practical and visually interesting, carved, wooden canes or walking sticks display a rich diversity of sculptural forms. Raised imagery, in the forms of people and animals, embellish handles; the snake-one of the more popular motifs- may encircle the entire length of a cane. Incised drawings and messages commemorating dates or events also adorn canes. Men carved a variety of imaginative canes throughout the nineteenth century, and the tradition continued to thrive until around World War I.  Canes are courtesy of Bonnie Grossman, The Ames Gallery. See \" #AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
