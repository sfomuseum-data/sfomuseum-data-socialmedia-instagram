        "body": "The flag carrier of Argentina, Aerolineas Argentinas, was founded in 1949. A consolidation of four companies, ALFA (Aviación del Litoral Fluvial Argentino), ZONDA (Zonas Oeste y Norte de Aerolíneas Argentinas), FAMA (Flota Aérea Mercante Argentina), and Aeroposta, the newly formed Aerolineas Argentinas, started service with an amalgamation of many different types of aircraft from the four companies. The long distance routes were flown by FAMA's DC-6s, northern domestic flights were flown by ZONDA's Convair CV-240s, while southern domestic flights were flown by Aeroposta's DC-3s. By 1958, the airline had put in an order for six de Havilland Comet 4 jet airliners. Have you ever been to Argentina?
