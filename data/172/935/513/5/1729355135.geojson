The African signs in our exhibition had been originally posted outdoors in warm climates, in an environment where many signs quickly weather. This sign in particular, collected by David Spetka of the Niger Bend, had severe flaking paint issues. Our conservator consolidated the paint layer by introducing adhesive beneath the lifting flakes of paint so that the sign could be safely displayed in our exhibition.
