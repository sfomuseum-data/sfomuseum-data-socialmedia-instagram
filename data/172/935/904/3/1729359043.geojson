        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1968, the first 747 rolled out of Boeing's Everett plant. When Boeing decided to build the 747, they realized that the giant plane would require a new assembly building. The purpose-built plant in Everett, Washington, is the largest building in the world by volume, at over 472 million cubic feet of space over almost 100 acres of land. Completed in 1968, a group of Boeing employees nicknamed \"The Incredibles\" built the first 747-100 at the same time that the building was also being constructed. Now more than 30,000 people work at the Boeing Everett plant. Have you ever been to the Boeing assembly building in Everett, Washington?  Image: Pan American World Airways, Boeing 747, late 1960s.
