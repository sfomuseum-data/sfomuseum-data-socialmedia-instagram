His name derived from the phrase “Western Air Lines Loves You.” The plump, yellow bird with the prominent beak was depicted reclining on the plane’s tail fin toasting Western’s luxurious passenger service by hoisting a glass of champagne. Wally’s catchphrase “It’s the Ooonly way to fly!” became ingrained in popular culture.  Image: Western Airlines playing cards, 1967. Gift of Thomas G. Dragges. 2010.105.386",
