While confined in a Japanese American internment camp during the Second World War, Asawa learned to draw from Tom Okamoto, a Disney animator also interned at the camp. After a trip to Mexico, she was inspired by looped wire basketry used to store produce and eggs in the marketplace. Asawa combined traditional Mexican wire looping with her line drawing designs and wove complex and flowing three-dimensional hanging mobiles, similar in construction to the egg basket pictured here.  See more art by #RuthAsawa in \"#AModernApproach: #MidCentury #Design\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AModernApproach ",
