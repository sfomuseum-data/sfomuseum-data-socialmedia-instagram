Photographing a selection of these animals at natural history museums worldwide, Ecclesiarhou has produced a collection of images that highlights these threatened species and seeks to increase public awareness about the imminent loss of biodiversity.  Though these animals are not yet extinct, Ecclesiarhou chose to photograph taxidermied specimens for her images, encouraging viewers to reflect: can they be conserved as living species in the wild, or are they fated to be preserved in dioramas at natural history museums?  See \"Epitaphs: Silent Stories\" by #PavlinaEcclesiarhou, pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2m6Yksl",
