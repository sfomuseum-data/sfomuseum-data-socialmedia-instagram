By 1934, she was the owner and operator of the Summit Flying School, which had a base at San Francisco Airport.  In addition to being one of a small number of female flight-school owners at the time, she also did much of her own mechanical work. Several pilots who learned from her even went on to work for Pan American Airways.  Image:  Janet Hall Knight, 1930. SFO Museum Collection. 2014.051.001",
