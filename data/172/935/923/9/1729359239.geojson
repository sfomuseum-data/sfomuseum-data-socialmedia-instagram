The color of the boots indicates the wearer’s position in society. Historically, the nobility wore boots on important occasions. Presently, they are worn by government officials, ordinary citizens, and are gaining popularity with tourists. Thick rubber soles have replaced the traditional thin leather soles, making them more comfortable to wear.  Shoes courtesy of Mingei International Museum.
