        "body": "Our exhibition featuring art from students from Jose Ortega Elementary School in San Francisco is closing soon.  The focus of their project was to cultivate an appreciation for the intricacy of flowers through observation from an artistic perspective. Each student selected a single image from hundreds of photographs of flowers. They then sketched their flowers using pencil on black construction paper. Once their drawings were complete, students traced their lines in glue. After allowing the glue to dry, students used chalk pastels to color their compositions. Through this art project, students were able to study different types of flowers and discover the beauty in the tiniest of patterns as they developed their artistic skills and translated their observations into unique works of art.",
