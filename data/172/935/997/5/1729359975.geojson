It's just possible that your home does have an air conditioning system which changes the air completely every ninety seconds. And maybe it boasts a lounge with a view clear to the horizon. Your personal palace may even contain luxurious sleeping accommodations for more than a dozen people. BUT â€“ we'll wager it doesn't whisk you across the world, 25,000 feet up, at over 300 miles per hour. (If it does, may we pay you a visit? That's a trick we'd like to see.) Seriously, the Double-Decked \"Strato\" Clippers, the type in which you are now relaxing, were carefully designed to offer you all the comforts of your own living room. With, of course, a few delightful differences, to which we'd like to point, with pardonable pride, in the next few pages!\"",
