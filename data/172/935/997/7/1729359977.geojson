Influenced by modern art and design, mid-century decorative arts were created in large numbers by manufacturers, and as unique pieces by craft and fine artists. Adaline Kent (1900–57) worked primarily in fine arts sculpture and crossed into the decorative arts with this sculpted candelabra. Kent was one of San Francisco’s leading surrealistic sculptors during the 1950s, known for her abstract and biomorphic carvings in stone, magnesite, and concrete.
