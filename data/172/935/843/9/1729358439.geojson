        "body": "\"The Hangar, Shrine of the Air\" was located on 2211 Union Street in Berkeley, California. For over 30 years, Mary E. Tusch lived here and invited many of the students of the United States School of Military Aeronautics on the University of California's Berkeley Campus to her home, which was across the street from the school. She was nicknamed \"Mother Tusch\" by the budding aviators, as she became like a second mother to many of them. Her love for aviation and subsequent collection of aviation related artifacts gave her home the nickname, \"The Hangar, Shrine of Air.\" In this photo you can see part of her immense collection. When she passed in 1960, her collection was donated to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  Images: San Francisco Bay Area, The Hangar (interior), Berkeley, 1949.
