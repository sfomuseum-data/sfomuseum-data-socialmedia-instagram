        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1959, the inaugural jetliner flight from SFO to New York departed. Operated by TWA (Trans World Airways), this first Boeing 707 flight officially launched SFO into the jet age. The speed of commercial jet aircraft, such as the Boeing 707, enabled airlines to offer customers dramatically reduced flying times. It was the capacity and efficiency of the jets, however, that dramatically reduced per-passenger costs. This in turn spurred a wave of economy fare programs. Have you ever flown on a Boeing 707?
