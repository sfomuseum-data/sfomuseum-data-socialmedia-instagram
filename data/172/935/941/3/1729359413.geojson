Such calendars promised rapid, comfortable travel to cities worldwide with scenes of the airline’s exciting destinations. Some, like the Trans World Airlines calendars, carefully placed the company’s aircraft in the scene, like this Lockheed Constellation over the Rhine River in Germany in this 1952 calendar.
