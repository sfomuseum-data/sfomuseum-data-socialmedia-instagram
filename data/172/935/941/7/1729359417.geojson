She told Frank [Merlo], ‘Oh, Mr. Williams has lost his mind! He stalks about the room talking out loud!’ Frank said, ‘Oh, he’s just writing.’ She didn’t understand that.” —Tennessee Williams  Born Thomas Lanier Williams III in Columbus, Mississippi, Tennessee Williams (1911–83) was one of America’s greatest playwrights. An intensely emotional and personal writer, Williams cast his characters from the heart, often drawing on family and life experiences for inspiration. The writer’s mother was the source for the character Amanda Wingfield in his first successful play, The Glass Menagerie, which opened on Broadway in 1945 and brought him overnight fame. Two years later, A Streetcar Named Desire premiered with Marlon Brando in the lead, winning Williams his first of two Pulitzer Prizes for drama. In all, he wrote more than two-dozen full-length plays, all of them produced on and off Broadway, in addition to a selection of short stories, poetry, and two novels.  See Tennessee Williams' 1936 Corona Junior #typewriter in our exhibition, \"The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Thetypewriter",
