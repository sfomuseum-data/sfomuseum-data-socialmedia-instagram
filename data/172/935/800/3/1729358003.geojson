        "body": "In the mountainous country of Nepal, the flag carrying airline, Nepal Airlines (previously Royal Nepal Airlines), traverses the country, landing and taking off on smalls airstrips. In the 1970s, the airline acquired a small fleet of STOL (short takeoff and landing) de Havilland Twin Otters to take on their challenging domestic routes. Elevations vary drastically in Nepal - even just across an airstrip. Twenty miles south of Mount Everest's peak, the Tenzing-HIllary Airport (also known as Lukla) has different elevations at the bottom and top of the landing strip, with a nearly 12 degree slope! Lukla has been dubbed as the most extreme airport in the world. Have you ever been to Nepal?  Image:  Royal Nepal Airlines postcard, de Havilland Twin Otter, 1970s. Gift of Thomas G.
