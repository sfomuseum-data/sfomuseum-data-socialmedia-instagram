        "body": "During the 1930s, E.H. Scott produced some of the most expensive radios ever made. Scott radios were advertised as “The Stradivarius of Radio” and included features found only on high-end sets such as extensive chrome plating and finely crafted cabinetry. In 1932, Scott introduced the Allwave Deluxe, a twelve-tube, three-band receiver that featured a five-stage sensitivity control to fine-tune stations depending on distance and electrical interference. An automatic volume control adjusted receiver sensitivity to coincide with changes in signal strength. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
