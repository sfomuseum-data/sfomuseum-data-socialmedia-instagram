        "body": "The Concorde was the first successful transoceanic supersonic airliner. Developed as a joint endeavor between the governments of Great Britain and France, the project encountered many delays due to the technical difficulty of flying at supersonic speeds. Finally, on January 21, 1976, Air France launched its Concorde SST (supersonic transport) service between Paris and Rio de Janeiro. The United States Congress initially banned Concorde service to the United States because of noise pollution concerns, but eventually allowed service to Washington Dulles International Airport. A supersonic transatlantic flight between Paris and Washington D.C. lasted on average just three and one-half hours at 1,350 miles per hour, faster than the speed of the Earth's rotation. The Concorde seated approximately one hundred people and had only one class, \"Concorde Class.\" All Concorde SSTs were retired in 2003. See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
