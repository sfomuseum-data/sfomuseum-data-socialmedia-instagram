        "body": "Ida Staggers was first hired by TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air) as a hostess in 1936. She initially made her mark within the airline during a high-profile cross-country business charter with the Guinness Company of Ireland. The captain of the charter commended her on making \"a lasting impression on the quality and efficiency of TWA service.\" As a result, she was promoted to instructor at the TWA hostess training school. By the 1940s, she had attained the position of Eastern Division Chief Hostess, which placed her in charge of hostess hiring, training, and working standards. She instructed TWA hostesses to be \"feminine,\" conduct themselves \"to gain respect for the uniform,\" and to always \"smile, your biggest, brightest smile.\" Ida Staggers remained with TWA for thirty-six years before retiring in 1972. #WomenInAviation  Image: Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air (TWA), Ida Staggers, 1941.
