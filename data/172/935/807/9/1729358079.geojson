In the 1970s, flight attendants started dressing in the spirit of “do your own thing.” These mix-and-match outfits by Louis remained unified by identifiable colors and patterns and included PANTS. This photo on United's Boeing 747 service features three different patterns, diamonds, stripes, and polka dots. Which one is your favorite?  Image: United Air Lines, Jean Louis uniforms, c. 1973.
