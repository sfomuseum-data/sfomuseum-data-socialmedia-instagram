        "body": "The first regularly scheduled North Atlantic southern route passenger service from the U.S. to Europe started #onthisday in 1939. Pan American Airways inaugurated two transatlantic routes in 1939, operated by Boeing B-314 flying boats. The southern route, inaugurated on this day, traveled from New York to Marseilles, France via the Azores and Lisbon, Portugal. The northern route, inaugurated on 24 June, went from New York to Southampton, England via Canada and Ireland. The cost of a one-way ticket from New York to Marseilles or Southampton was $375 in 1939, which has the same buying power as $6,481.19 today. The inaugural flight from New York to Lisbon took almost 24 hours! Today a non-stop flight time from New York to Lisbon is about seven hours. Have you ever flown on a transatlantic flight?
