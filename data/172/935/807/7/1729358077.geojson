        "body": "Similar to ships-in-bottles, but positioned upright, whimsey bottles contain a variety of imagery. To position parts, craftsmen might employ a long instrument through the bottle’s mouth before sealing the bottle. Anything larger than the mouth of the bottle is folded, then opened, assembled, and adhered inside. Miniature items found inside bottles range from furniture to fans, flowers, and yarn winders. Sailors, prisoners, lumbermen, and the chronically ill—people who were often isolated or confined—typically crafted whimsies.  Bottles courtesy of Bonnie Grossman, The Ames Gallery. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
