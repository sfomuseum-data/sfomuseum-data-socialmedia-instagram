        "body": "Painter Pietro Cappelli’s vision—creative, insistent, and extreme—is dexterously laid out in his architectural fantasies. Here, buildings and their remains run well past the edges of the frame. This richly painted and extravagantly architectural capriccio is a fine example of Pietro Cappelli’s mature work. The soft, marine sunlight catches the ancient architecture and bronze equestrian sculpture and casts dramatic shadows across their facades. Some three centuries later, the well-preserved canvas retains the original detail of the figures and the delicate vines overgrowing the ruined stone.  All objects are from the Collection of Piraneseum. See \"All Roads Lead to #Rome: 17th–19th Century Architectural Souvenirs from the Collection of #Piraneseum\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AllRoadsRome ",
