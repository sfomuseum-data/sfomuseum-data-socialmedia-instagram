        "body": "During the late 1890s, as machining became prevalent and mechanical appliances were increasingly accessible, slot machine companies proliferated. Many of the color-wheel and roulette-based gambling devices, popularized as freestanding machines in carved, wooden cabinets, were also produced as ornate, cast-iron versions for the countertops of saloons and cigar stores. The Little Monte Carlo allowed five-way play with payouts determined by the color played. Mills Novelty Company produced this popular roulette machine from 1899 to 1915.  All objects are courtesy of the Joe Welch American Antique Museum.
