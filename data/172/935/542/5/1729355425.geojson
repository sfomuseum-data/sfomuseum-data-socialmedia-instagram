        "body": "Before the advent of photography, a number of superbly illustrated books made by Western travelers and artists in the early nineteenth century helped fuel the public’s fascination with foreign locales. Englishmen Thomas and William Daniell published the most extensive visual record of India— Oriental Scenery (London, 1795–1807)— in six volumes over several years. Their prints depicted the stunning landscapes and historic architecture of India and introduced viewers to the sites and scenes of distant lands they could only dream of experiencing in person. French wallpaper manufacturers drew freely from these publications to create panoramic papers. English pottery manufacturers also drew from these prints. “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” is on display, pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
