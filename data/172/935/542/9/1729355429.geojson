        "body": "On March 16, 1947, the Convair 240 made its maiden flight. The Convair 240 was the first postwar commercial airliner developed by Convair of San Diego. It was designed to be a pressurized, mid-range replacement for the DC-3 that was easy to service and turnover between flights. It featured a built-in, drop-down stairway for quick passenger loading, petal-style engine cowlings for rapid maintenance, and tricycle-configuration landing gear. It could carry forty passengers comfortably and had a range of up to 1,200 miles.  Introduced by American Airlines in 1948, 176 were produced for numerous airlines worldwide.
