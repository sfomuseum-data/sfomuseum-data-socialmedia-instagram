In 1947, the airline changed its name to The Flying Tiger Line, a reference to the pilots who operated in the Far East theatre of WWII and were called 'Flying Tigers.â€™ Though primarily a cargo airline, The Flying Tiger Line had a few scheduled passenger flights. It was absorbed into Federal Express (now known as FedEx) in 1989. Do you remember the Flying Tiger Line?",
