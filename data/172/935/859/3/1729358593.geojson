        "body": "Fraternal organizations thrived in America in the nineteenth century. One of the prevalent groups, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, provided camaraderie, engaged in various charitable causes, and encouraged the strengthening of moral character among members. Members also decorated lodges with emblematic pieces, such as plaques and mirrors. The all-seeing eye is a common symbol to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.  Plaque courtesy of the collection of Ian Berke. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
