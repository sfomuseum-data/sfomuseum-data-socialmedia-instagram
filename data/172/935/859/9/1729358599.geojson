        "body": "\"Completely New in Comfort and Fresh, Smart Styling\" TECO advertised their seats in TWA's Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation as the ultimate passenger comfort. This passenger seat was used exclusively by TWA in the Lockheed 1049G or, \"Super G,\" Constellation, introduced in 1955. It was touted as one of the most spacious and comfortable seats to be installed in an airliner at the time. It included deep-foam-rubber cushioning, upholstered armrests with built-in ashtrays, and large seatback pockets. It had a multi-position, cable-activated reclining mechanism, and also featured one of the first uses of molded Fiberglas side covers. The color and materials were designed to harmonize with the luxurious cabin interiors designed by the firm of Henry Dreyfuss Associates. The fabric was carefully coordinated with the cabin's interior color scheme, and the headrest was usually covered with a removable cloth or \"antimacassar.\" Image: TECO, TWA (Trans World Airlines), Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation, c. 1954, SFO Museum Collection, 2015.120.001",
