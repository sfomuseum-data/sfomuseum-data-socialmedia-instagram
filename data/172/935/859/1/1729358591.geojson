        "body": "Decorated with red glaze and gold ornamentation, this maneki neko figure comes from the Kutani kilns, established in the late 1600s. Unlike other beckoning cats, Kutani cats typically sit facing forward while leaning heavily to one side; the cat's ears also turn to the side. The most flamboyant Kutani maneki neko, many of which are exported to China, display decorative motifs with raised lines in bold shades of gold and red.  This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum. \"Maneki Neko: Japanese Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
