        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1959, TWA (Trans World Airlines) inaugurated transcontinental Boeing 707 jet service from San Francisco International Airport to New York. The aircraft, N732TW, was delivered just three days earlier and was the first 707 received by the airline. Amid tight competition with American Airlines, which had launched its first jet service on January 25th, TWA pushed ahead its inaugural flight and successfully operated the service for a month with this single aircraft, before its other deliveries were received. This was an incredible accomplishment for the airlineâ€™s engineers and mechanics. The speed of commercial jet aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, enabled airlines to offer customers dramatically reduced flying times. The capacity and efficiency of the jets dramatically reduced costs. This in turn spurred a wave of economy fare programs. Have you ever flown in a Boeing 707?",
