        "body": "This is your last week to catch \"Fashion In Flight: A History of Airline Uniform Design.\" The airline uniform occupies a unique place in the history of women’s wear. For more than eighty-five years, the female passenger-service and safety professional—variably called stewardess, hostess, and flight attendant—has been dressed in outfits designed to signify a distinct role in the workplace, project the identity of their employer, and reflect prevailing fashions of the times. These sometime conflicting demands of singularity, diversity, and conformity have created a distinct type of attire, one that has penetrated deeply into the social conscience of popular culture while presenting fashion designers with remarkable challenges and creative opportunities. \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/FashionInFlight1  Image: Pan American World Airways flight attendants reunion, 2010.
