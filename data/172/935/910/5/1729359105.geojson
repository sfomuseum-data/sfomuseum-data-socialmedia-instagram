        "body": "In Chinese opera, an actor will typically devote their opera training to a single type of role. The costumes the actors wear, including their shoes, are unique to the characters they play. Actors playing powerful generals typically wear thick-soled boots. Some female characters wear colored shoes with tassels and floral embroidery, while others wear “flowerpot-sole” shoes, colored shoes with added platforms shaped like inverted flowerpots.  Chinese opera stage sets are kept minimal. The actors and their vibrant costumes serve as the focal point in the theater. The costumes are typically based on Ming dynasty (1368–1644) fashions, even when the drama takes place during a different era.  Shoes and images courtesy of Sally Yu Leung. See more shoes from all over the world in \"Stepping Out: Shoes in World Culture\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ShoesinCulture . . . #ShoesinCulture #shoes #instashoes #shoestagram #shoeswag #shoesoftheday #shoedesign #shoefashion #shoeslover #chineseopera #chinesechoes #chinese #china #opera #operashoes #",
