        "body": "In her project, \"Soup\", Mandy Barker draws attention to the increasing concern over oceanic plastics. Barker travels the globe, visiting beaches and recovering bits of plastic ranging in size from industrial microplastics to commonplace products such as toothbrushes and bottle caps. Back in her studio, she uses these collections of marine detritus as source material for her dizzying large-scale photographs. Meticulously sorting, arranging, and photographing from various distances, Barker composes images that seek to visually overwhelm, while educating the public about the detrimental effects of marine plastic. \"Soup\" by Mandy Barker (@mandybarkerphotography)  is located, pre-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2iGDbEh",
