        "body": "After the Second World War, typewriter manufacturers that had converted to arms production returned to the typewriter business. Most “new” models were mechanically similar, and at times identical, to pre-war machines—re-introduced with catchy names in updated bodies, colors, and trim packages. Based on their first portable of 1926, post-war Royals added trademark features from standard Royal desktop machines such as “Touch Control” to adjust key sensitivity, and “Magic Margin” to automatically control page margins. With a restyled case by industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss (1904–72), the Quiet De Luxe was offered in an array of bright, mid-century colors, including a custom-order, gold-plated option also given as a prize for student writing contests. Did you ever own a Royal typewriter?  Typewriter courtesy of California Typewriter.
