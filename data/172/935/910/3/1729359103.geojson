In 2015, we presented, \"I Love You California\" which explored the state’s natural history and touched on its cultural history through the collections of the California Academy of Sciences. Invertebrates from abalone to deep sea squid, birds such as acorn woodpeckers and tufted puffins, plant pressings including the state flower, the California poppy, land and marine mammal skulls, fossils, and a myriad of minerals, were some of the many specimens that illustrated the diversity of the “Golden State.” What is your favorite thing about California?",
