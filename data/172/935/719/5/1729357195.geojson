        "body": "Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, a household’s inventory of silver items indicated its wealth and status. Solid silver, known as 99.99 percent silver, and sterling with at least 92.5 percent silver, were the most valuable. During the Industrial Revolution, new silver-plating techniques made silver items less costly and more widely available. Silversmiths experimented with imaginative designs and ignited a Victorian passion for collecting a wide variety of ostentatious silver-plated tableware. Knife rests, cruet holders, napkin rings, tea sets, soup tureens, and egg holders are a sampling of the exhaustive list of silver-plated tableware manufactured during the period. Animal forms and motifs adorned many of these items, and the cat was well represented.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
