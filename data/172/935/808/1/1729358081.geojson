Our Video Arts screening room is dedicated to LGBT films this month and don't miss our exhibition on Gilbert Baker, the creator of the #rainbowflag. One of the photo featured in our exhibition is from San Francisco Pride forty years ago featuring Harvey Milk, the first openly gay official elected in California, with the first rainbow flags visible in the distance. Have a happy and safe Pride weekend!  Photograph by Mick Hicks. See \"#ALegacyOfPride: #GilbertBaker and the 40th Anniversary of the #RainbowFlag\" on view pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/RainbowFlagSFO",
