        "body": "The DC-10 was McDonnell Douglas’ answer to Boeing’s wide-body 747 jumbo-jet. The aircraft incorporated a tri-jet engine configuration with two engines mounted under the wings and one incorporated into the vertical stabilizer assembly. The aircraft had a slightly smaller capacity of up to 400 passengers, yet offered similar wide-body spaciousness and comfort to the 747. The DC-10 also featured first-class and coach lounges, a lower deck galley, and acoustic treatment of the fuselage. UTA introduced the aircraft in 1973, and by the mid-1970s, the carrier was operating it on many of its long-haul transatlantic routes to North and South America.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
