        "body": "Airlines discovered early that providing children with jobs, albeit pretend ones, was a way to make them feel useful and keep them from getting bored on long flights. Similar to having children help at home, carriers enlisted child participation in the flight by making them part of a junior flight crew, while also encouraging them to imagine a possible future career in commercial aviation. Beginning in the late 1940s, this included issuing junior pilot and flight attendant wings. Do you have any junior pilot or flight attendant wings?
