        "body": "In 1896, Franz Xaver Wagner (1837â€“1907) introduced a machine that provided the blueprint for modern typewriters used in offices throughout the world. Manufactured first as the Underwood No. 1, it featured a four-row keyboard with single-shift, and most importantly, an ingenious front-strike type-bar mechanism that wrote quickly and visibly with ease. The Underwood was such a success that by 1939, over five million examples had been produced with only minimal improvement to the original design. Almost every manual typewriter made after 1920 incorporated its slotted-segment, front-strike type-bar layout.
