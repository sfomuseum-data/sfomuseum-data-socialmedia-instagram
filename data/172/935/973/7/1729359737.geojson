        "body": "The father and son in this photograph from 1917 claim to be transcribing a novel from Jack London, who died in 1916, through the medium of the Ouija board.  A 1917 New York Times article proclaimed, “The ouija board seems to have come to stay as a competitor of the typewriter in the production of fiction. For this is the third novel in the last few months that has claimed the authorship of some dead and gone being who, unwilling to give up human activities, has appeared to find in the ouija board a material means of expression.” The Times article was referring to Jap Herron (1917), a book Emily Grant Hutchings claimed Mark Twain posthumously penned via the talking board. Twain’s family, who owned the rights to his works, quickly halted the book from further publication.
