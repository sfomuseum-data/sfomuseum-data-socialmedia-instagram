        "body": "Spode Pottery introduced their Caramanian series around 1809. Caramania historically referred to the southern coast of Turkey, known as the Turquoise Coast. Spode copied imagery from the twenty-four aquatints in Views in the Ottoman Empire (1803) for their series. The whimsical border pattern on the series, which features a number of animals, was drawn from the aquatints in Oriental Field Sports (1807). Imagery from the print “Antique Fragments at Limisso,” displayed on the pieces here, may represent Kolossi Castle in Limassol, on the south coast of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean.  All objects and images are from the collection of Michael Sack. \"From #PrintToPlate: Views of the East on Transferware\" is on display, every day, 24 hours a day, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/PrintToPlate",
