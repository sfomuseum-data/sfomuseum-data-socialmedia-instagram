        "body": "Aircraft prototypes must undergo a wide range of tests during the pre-production process. Cold weather tests were performed on the Concorde SST prototype 02 in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1974. In order to obtain certification, it had to pass a cold soak test to demonstrate that it could be operated in below freezing, cold weather conditions. During this overnight test on the ground the aircraft was exposed to temperatures below -44Â°C. The next morning the Concorde prototype was put through a series of systems tests, all of which it passed without difficulty. Air France and British Airways introduced the Concorde SST two years later. Did you ever fly on a Concorde?  Image: Air France promotional print, Concorde, c. 1974.
