He mixed the traditionalism of the suit’s peaked lapels, cuff ranks, and dropped hemline with the contemporary look of the brightly colored, wave-pattern print blouse. An alpine-style, black felt hat coordinates with the skinny belt. This uniform was issued from 1974 to 1983. \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/FashionInFlight1",
