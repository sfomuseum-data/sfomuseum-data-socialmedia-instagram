        "body": "A romantic, classical composition in grisaille featuring architectural elements dotting a tranquil garden, “Les Lointains” was first offered in 1825. Grisailles, or prints executed in predominantly gray hues, were created for consumers who wanted a subtler effect in a room. In most instances, they were less expensive than full-color papers. Even so, grisaille papers capture the smallest details, such as veining on a leaf, as precisely as woodblock printing with opaque colors allows. Each detail requires a separate woodblock, and eleven colors are used to create “Les Lointains”. This version also includes yellow hues. In addition to this shade, “Les Lointains” is offered in a green tone as well as a grisaille with colored flowers sprinkled in the foreground. “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” is on display, pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
