The purpose-built plant in Everett, Washington, is one of the largest building in the world, at over 472 million cubic feet of space on almost 100 acres of land. Completed in 1968, a group of Boeing employees nicknamed \"The Incredibles\" built the first 747-100 at the same time that the building was also being constructed. Now more than 30,000 people work at the Boeing Everett plant. Have you ever been to the Boeing assembly building in Everett, Washington?  Image: Boeing photograph, c. 1971.
