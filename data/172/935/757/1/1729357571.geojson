        "body": "Powerful rhythm-and-blues singer Big Mama Thornton (1926–84) was first to record the songs “Hound Dog” and her own composition, “Ball n’ Chain,” which would later be made famous by Elvis Presley and Janis Joplin. Growing up in Alabama with a minister for a father, Thornton began singing in church at an early age; she also learned to play the harmonica and drums. Her career began to flourish after she moved to Houston, Texas. In the late 1950s, as rock-and-roll became more popular and her career began to wane, she relocated to the Bay Area, performing at local clubs. During the 1960s folk music revival, she made several records with Arhoolie and performed at a number of festivals in the United States and Europe. https://folkways.si.edu/big-mama-thornton-with-the-muddy-waters-blues-band-1966/blues/music/album/smithsonian  Special thank you to Chris Strachwitz, @Smithsonian @Folkways Recordings, and @ArhoolieFdn. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
