Hired in 1987, John has held a number of different positions at SFO Museum, but his legacy is founding our Aviation Museum and overseeing the acquisition of over 140,000 objects into the collection. He also has an almost encyclopedic knowledge about the history of the Airport and is SFOâ€™s unofficial historian. This is not a good bye but a see you later. We hope you enjoy your retirement! Have fun fishing!",
