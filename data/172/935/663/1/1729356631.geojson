        "body": "Jane Short studied jewelry at London’s Central School of Art and Design and was introduced to enameling by her instructor Patrick Furse (1918–2005) during her second year of coursework. Short recalls “liking the rich quality of the color and the way the light reflected through it. I fell in love with the technique.” Upon graduation, she studied silversmithing under Gerald Benney (1930–2008) and was encouraged by his introduction of color in his silver a few years earlier. Short’s early work reflects her use of cloisonné, in which the enamels are applied within compartments formed by affixed wires or strips of silver. Her current work frequently employs champlevé (enamel in carved or etched cells) and basse-taille (enamel in an engraved or chased low-relief pattern) to produce painterly images that are modeled on her watercolor designs. The stunning decoration of Malcolm Appleby’s Oil Slick tumbler resulted from the designer’s request for Short to enamel this challenging surface.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
