        "body": "Loftleiðir Icelandic (or Iceland Airlines) was established on March 10, 1944 in Iceland. As Iceland is geographically situated between Europe and the United States, Loftleiðir became a major player in the transatlantic travel in the 1960s. A combination of the Icelandic words for air and way, Loftleiðir became known as a low-cost way for Americans to experience Europe. In 1973, Loftleiðir merged with Flugfélag Íslands to form Icelandair, the current flag carrier of Iceland. Did you ever fly on Loftleiðir?
