        "body": "“Ocean Voices II” is an epic wood sculpture. Ursula von Rydingsvard has created sculptures out of cedar wood for the past 35 years. Her longstanding use of wood is linked to memories of the makeshift structures that her Ukranian-Polish family inhabited while moving from one displaced-persons camp to the next across postwar Germany. Using circular saws and chisels, she and her assistants have patiently carved and chipped at cedar 4-by-4's to create this monumental form.  See “Ocean Voices II” by Ursula von Rydingsvard is on display, post-security in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2Tnja4z",
