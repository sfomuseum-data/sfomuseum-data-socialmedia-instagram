        "body": "One of the greatest advances in commercial aviation was the successful introduction of jet airliners during the late 1950s. Although introduced after the British de Havilland Comet and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104, the Boeing 707 was the first commercial jetliner to provide regular, sustained commercial airline service and thus revolutionized the airline industry, while effectively ushering in the jet age of air travel. #OnThisDay in 1957, the first Boeing 707 took flight from Renton Municipal Airport. N708PA, the aircraft that took this first test flight, was delivered to Pan American World Airways on November 30, 1958. Pan American inaugurated 707 service in October 1958. By October 1983, Pan American and TWA (Trans World Airlines) retired their Boeing 707s. Did you ever fly on a Boeing 707?
