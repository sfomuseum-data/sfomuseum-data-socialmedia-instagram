        "body": "California Central Airlines (CCA) was a short-lived post-war airline based in Burbank, California. Starting in 1948, the airline offered flights from Burbank to Oakland with the low fare of $9.99 one way (approximately $100 today). In 1952, the airlineâ€™s low fares attracted 137,000 passengers. However, their fares were too low for CCA to be economically viable, and they declared bankruptcy in 1954.  Image: California Central Airlines advertisement, c. 1953, Gift of Thomas G.
