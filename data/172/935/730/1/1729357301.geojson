        "body": "The 767 was the first two-engine widebody airliner to be produced by Boeing. It was designed to be a smaller widebody airliner than the 747 with a capacity between two-hundred and three-hundred passengers and the range for most transoceanic routes. It also featured a “glass cockpit,” or all-digital, LCD flight instrument display panels and could be operated by two pilots. During the 1980s, Qantas purchased six of the Boeing 767-200ER (ER for extra range), and forty-one of the 767-300ER, which proved ideal for the carrier’s expansion into the Asian market, where the 747 was too large for customer demand. To commemorate the event, the airline introduced a new corporate look, a fresh livery for the aircraft, and a new line of cabin and ground crew uniforms. These spacious, comfortable, widebody airliners proved reliable and economical to operate for Qantas over the next two decades.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
