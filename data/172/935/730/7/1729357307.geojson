Illustrated here is St. Peter's Square, which is actually located in the independent city-state of Vatican City enclaved within Rome. Alitalia – Linee Aeree Italiane, was the flag carrier of Italy from 1947 to 2009. After bankruptcy, the airline was reformed as Alitalia – Società Aerea Italiana. The airline's name is an Italian portmanteau of the words ali (wings), and Italia (Italy). Have you ever been to Rome?  Image: Alitalia postcard, Rome, 1949. Gift of Thomas G. Dragges. 2015.166.0192",
