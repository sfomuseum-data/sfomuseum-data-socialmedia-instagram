        "body": "Married in 1910, Osa and Martin Johnson conducted four African safaris in the 1920s. For their fifth trip, they acquired two Sikorsky amphibian airplanes and flew the length of the continent capturing unique photographic images and film footage, including the Serengeti migrations, Mt. Kilimanjaro, and Mt. Kenya. After Martin perished in 1937, Osa wrote “I Married Adventure”, which was also made into a feature-length movie in 1940.  Our exhibition exploring aerial archeology \"#TerraCognito: Published Works of Discovery by Aerial Explorers\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library located in the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily, from 10am to 4:30pm. http://bit.ly/TerraCognito #avgeek #aviationhistory  I Married Adventure movie poster  1940 paper, ink Courtesy of Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum, Chanute, Kansas R2016.1703.001",
