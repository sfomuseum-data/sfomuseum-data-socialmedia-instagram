Forrest, hoping to familiarize his audience with India, spent the first half of the book relaying a history of India.  The Ganges River, located in Northern India, was the main thoroughfare for journeys between Calcutta and the upcountry. Accustomed to much smaller rivers in Europe, the mighty Ganges, and the vast subcontinent of India itself—so markedly different from England—awed British artists and writers. Many traveled up the Ganges sketching the profusion of architectural sites and varied natural landscapes they saw along the way. Artists recorded everything from ruins, mosques, and temples, to mountain ranges and rock outcrops.  All objects and images are from the collection of Michael Sack. \"From #PrintToPlate: Views of the East on #Transferware\" is on display, every day, 24 hours a day, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/PrintToPlate",
