        "body": "#OnThisday in 1959, United Air Lines and Delta Airlines introduced the Douglas DC-8. In the competition with Boeing to create the first American-produced turbojet airliner, Douglas developed the DC-8 in the late 1950s and introduced it in 1959, nearly a year after Boeing introduced their 707 jetliner. Some airlines, like United, invested entirely in DC-8s, as opposed to expanding their fleets with both the DC-8 and the 707. With the Douglas DC-8, coast-to-coast travel time from west to east was less than six hours. The interiors of the new jets were far more spacious and quiet than any of the propeller-driven airliners. With more interior space, greater attention was paid to inflight amenities such as elaborate, multi-course meal service, inflight movies, and individualized air conditioning controls. Have you ever flown on a DC-8?  Image: United Airlines promotional aircraft print, Douglas DC-8, 1959- 1980. Gift of David A. Abercrombie, in memory of Stanley A. Abercrombie. 2001.039.285 a c",
