        "body": "Eastern Air Lines brought nostalgic traditionalism to uniform design in the 1990s. Issued with slacks and the midi skirt with matching blazer, this uniform includes the waistcoat style vest of an earlier era. The collection was introduced with the tag line “The hat is back!” for the retro overseas cap by Frank Olive (1929–1995). A classic chain link and medallion pattern scarf adds a touch of burgundy to the outfit. #FashionFriday  See more 1980s fashion in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and the Main Hall of the International Terminal.
