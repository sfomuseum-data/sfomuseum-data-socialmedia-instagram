Beginning in the 1930s, airline tickets have consisted of long, rectangular strips of paper, or coupons, for each leg of a flight. Tickets usually came in a jacket that incorporated the name and logo of the carrier, along with aircraft and service promotions. A flight packet with information about the airline, the flight, and the destination was often included. http://bit.ly/2h0zFQe",
