        "body": "Hand painted signs for barbershops and hairdressers have a rich history in Africa. Barbers and hairdressers are responsible for most of the intricately braided women’s hairstyles. Barbershops and hair salons may consist of a simple structure with a hand-painted sign nailed to its exterior. Female hairstylists often hang several signs depicting dozens of different braided hairstyles for clients to consider with clever titles.  See more hand painted signs for barber shops and hairdressers from all over West Africa and Kenya in “Extra ‘O”! African Barbershop and Hairdressing Signs,” online at: http://bit.ly/Extrao",
