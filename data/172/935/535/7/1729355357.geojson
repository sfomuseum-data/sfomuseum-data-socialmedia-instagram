The 747 offered a comfortable, roomy, and luxurious cabin interior. In an advertisement, BOAC proclaimed, “you will hardly believe you're in an aircraft” and described the jumbojet’s interior as “very like a cinema auditorium,” yet with larger seats and superior food. The airline also touted the unique and opulent upstairs first-class lounge.  See “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” online at:  http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
