        "body": "The Convair 990 Coronado took off on its maiden flight #onthisday in 1961. Though only 37 built were built during the 2 years of production, the Convair 990 was (and still remains) the fastest subsonic commercial airliner. At the time, American Airlines and Convair bet that the airline industry was headed towards faster jetliners. With four CJ805-23 turbofan engines, the maximum cruising speed of the Coronado was 615 miles per hour. American initially ordered 25 of the jetliner but ultimately reduced their purchase after test flights showed it would not meet the expected performance standards.
