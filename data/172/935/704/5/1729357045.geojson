        "body": "Shapers are artisans who create surfboards from shaping materials such as foam and wood. By pairing iconic shapers with select sources of rare wood, Larry Fuller (b. 1954) has assembled a collection of boards that illustrate the progression of surfboard design through a common medium. Fuller crafted his first wooden board from agave and redwood close to three decades ago while working for surfer-shaper Jim Phillips (b. 1946). Over the next few years, Fuller made connections to surfer-shapers including George Downing (1930–2018), Dick “RB” Brewer (b. 1936), and Donald Takayama (1943–2012), who established the foundation for a more extensive legacy project. This exhibition features twenty-seven wooden surfboards selected from more than 100 examples constructed by Fuller and his team over the past decade.  See \"Reflections in Wood — Surfboards and Shapers\" now on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/SurfboardsAndShapers . . .",
