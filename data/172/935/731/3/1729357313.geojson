        "body": "Happy Thanksgiving! This year, SFO Museum is thankful for our new office and storage building. A brand new, purpose-built facility, it houses a significant portion of our aviation collection and all of our exhibition production shops. One of our favorite additions is the 16-foot high compacting shelving units in our collections storage room. While the square  footage of our new collections storage room is smaller than that of our previous one, it has almost 25,000 cubic feet more of storage, thanks to those new shelves!",
