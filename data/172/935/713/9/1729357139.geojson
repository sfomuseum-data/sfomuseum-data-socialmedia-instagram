        "body": "This is your last week to see \"Isamu Noguchi: Inside and Out.\" The American sculptor Isamu Noguchi is one of the essential visionaries of the twentieth century. Working across a wide range of disciplines with a deep sense of social purpose for more than six decades, the artist developed a uniquely open-ended, inclusive, and forward-looking perspective on global culture. \"Isamu Noguchi: Inside and Out\" is drawn from Noguchi's last two forays in sheet metal kirigami, combined with his most successful and ubiquitous expansion of the practice of sculpture, his electrified paper-and-bamboo Akari lanterns.  Thank you to The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum for their generous loan. See \"Isamu Noguchi: Inside and Out\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/NoguchiSFO . . .",
