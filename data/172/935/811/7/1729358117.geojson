        "body": "Novelty radios focused on fitting in rather than standing out. Often found on a bookshelf or office desk, novelty sets were designed as fully functional radios and sometimes looked almost indistinguishable from the objects they copied. Novelty radios also advertised products and promoted new technologies. The RCA X-11, a compact, promotional Bakelite radio, used miniature multi-unit tubes that were developed during the Second World War and introduced to the civilian radio market in 1946.  Radio courtesy of Steve Kushman. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
