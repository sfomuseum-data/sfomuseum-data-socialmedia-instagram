        "body": "From picnics in the park, to outings at the beach or simply relaxing in the backyard, portable radios brought the style and excitement of radio technology outdoors. In 1924, Zenith introduced their Companion model, the first portable, self-contained radio offered by a major manufacturer. Although the Companion featured a revolutionary enclosure that held batteries and a built-in speaker, it was heavy, expensive, and ahead of its time. During the late 1930s, improvements in vacuum tube technology paved the way for modern portable radios. Inspired by fashions in luggage design, these lightweight radios were housed in hinged, wooden cases covered in tweed cloth or textured leatherette. Radios such as the Remler 92 operated on battery power, while most sets were “plug-in portables” that switched from AC household current to battery operation. By 1939, more than 150 portable radio models were available, including Zenith’s popular Universal portable complete with a patented “Wavemagnet” aerial antenna. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
