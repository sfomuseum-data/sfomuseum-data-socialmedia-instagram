The name was suggested by Catherine FitzGerald, Delta Employee Number 6 and Assistant Treasurer and Private Secretary to the company's principal founder and first CEO, C.E. Woolman. \"Miss Fitz\" was also one of the first women to sit on an airlineâ€™s board of directors, which she did between 1930-1934. When she retired from Delta in 1968, she held the first-ranked position for employee longevity.  Image: Delta Air Lines luggage label, 1940s. Gift of Captain Jon Simmonds. 2015.057.585",
