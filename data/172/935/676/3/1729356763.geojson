        "body": "By the late 1930s, toasters were redesigned with clean, curved housings reminiscent of streamlined train cars. The Toast-O-Lator was designed by Alfredo de Matteis, Alvin C. Goddard and William A. Pentecost with a smooth housing, speed lines, and an aircraft-like viewing window that allowed the user to see the conveyor-belt toasting mechanism at work. Designed by Jean Otis Reinecke (1909–1987) and James Barnes (1908–1986) with an exceedingly aerodynamic appearing exterior, the Toastmaster model 1B12 toaster was presented in advertisements as though it was the latest cutting-edge aircraft or car to be introduced amidst great public fanfare.  See \"Streamlines: Air Age Aesthetics for Industrial Design\" on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Streamlines",
