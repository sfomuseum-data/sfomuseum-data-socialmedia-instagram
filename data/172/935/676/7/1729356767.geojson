        "body": "Ndidi Ekubia is a graduate of London’s Royal College of Art. She employs traditional silversmithing techniques to push sheet silver to its working limits in her Manchester studio. Of Nigerian descent, Ekubia cites inspiration from her African heritage to create flowing, sculptural, and highly expressive forms that range from small, domestic items to stunning centerpieces. The form of Ekubia’s Flamingo vase, hand-raised from a single sheet, appears liquid, as if the silver is flowing upward from the eye of a cyclone. Examples of Ekubia’s silver are held in such prestigious collections as the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
