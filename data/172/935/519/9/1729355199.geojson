In 2018, we presented “A Legacy of Pride: Gilbert Baker and the 40th Anniversary of the Rainbow Flag” featuring a rainbow flag sewn by Gilbert Baker, the original designer of what has now become the universal symbol of queer pride. He assigned symbolic meaning to each of the flag’s original eight colors—pink for sexuality, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for art, indigo for peace and harmony, and purple for spirit. Do you remember this exhibition? https://bit.ly/3eiTsa4",
