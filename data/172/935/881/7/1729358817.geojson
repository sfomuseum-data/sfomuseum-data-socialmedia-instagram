Working with single-use materials, Albertson produces photographs that borrow from the language of abstraction. Straws, napkins, rubber bands, and other items—often consigned to the edges of our desks or the depths of our kitchen drawers—are repurposed and foregrounded in his large-scale images. \"One Hundred Count\" by Nick Albertson is on display, pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2AGWsNb",
