        "body": "Happy Pan American Aviation Day! #OnThisDay in 1903, the Wright brothers successfully flew a heavier-than-air, mechanically propelled and piloted aircraft at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 1940, following years of significant advancements in aviation, President Franklin D. Roosevelt honored the Wright brothersâ€™ early achievement by issuing a proclamation designating December 17th as Pan American Aviation Day. This commemoration encourages citizens from North, Central, and South America to increase their interest in aviation.  Image: Wright brothers first flight, 1903. SFO Museum Collection.
