The DC-9 was designed by Douglas as a mid-range jetliner with a smaller capacity than the Boeing 727 and with the capability of serving the short runways of small regional airports. Similar to the Sud Aviation Caravelle, it featured two jet engines mounted at the rear of the fuselage and a high-mounted horizontal stabilizer. The DC-9-10 series was equipped with Pratt \u0026 Whitney JT8D turbofan engines. The DC-9 was highly successful for numerous airlines worldwide.  Have you ever flown on a DC-9?",
