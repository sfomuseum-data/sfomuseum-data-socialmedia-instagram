        "body": "Victorian pedestals, meant to showcase sculpture, are fascinating decorative art objects to behold. These stands showcased vases, candleholders, and plants. Several pedestals displaying artistic objects might adorn the drawing room or parlor. Victorians selected pedestals that suited their tastes and living interiors. Pedestals, as a result, offer an intriguing look at the design styles popular at the time. The pedestal stands in isolation in a room, its only purpose to elevate sculpture. But during the Victorian era, pedestals dazzled the eye as much as the items placed upon them. This exhibition showcases a number of stunning examples produced in the United States from the 1860s to the 1890s. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
