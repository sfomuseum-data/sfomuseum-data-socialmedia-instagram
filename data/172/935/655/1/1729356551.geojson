        "body": "Animals, both mythical and real, have appeared in fine and decorative arts and architecture for centuries. In addition to serving as decoration, they have also conveyed a wealth of symbolism. The griffin has the body and tail of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. It may be grouped with other fantastical beasts such as the dragon, phoenix, and sphinx. Historically, griffins symbolized royalty and served as protectors of the dead. The griffin also keeps a watchful eye, while evoking strength, courage, vigilance, and perseverance. Griffin sculptures frequently appear in medieval-era church architecture. This ebonized pedestal, in the form of a robust, dramatic griffin commands attention and would have certainly competed with any sculpture placed upon it. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
