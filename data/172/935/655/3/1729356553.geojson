        "body": "In her series, “Heterotopia”, Brooklyn-based artist Karine Laval produces dreamlike images that challenge and transform our experience of the natural world. Utilizing two-way mirrors and Mylar sheeting, the artist uses the natural environment as both subject matter and plein air studio, transforming ordinary landscapes into a series of kaleidoscopic composites that oscillate between the real and the imaginary. Riding a fine line between representation and abstraction, Laval’s images challenge our perception and highlight photography’s ability to simultaneously reveal, conceal, and distort reality. “Heterotopia” by Karine Laval is on display, post-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2VN0E5t ",
