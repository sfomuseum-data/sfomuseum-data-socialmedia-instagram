        "body": "One of the greatest advances in commercial aviation was the successful introduction of jet airliners during the late 1950s. Although introduced after the British de Havilland Comet and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104, the Boeing 707 was the worldâ€™s first viable commercial jetliner to provide regular and sustained scheduled commercial airline service. The 707 revolutionized the airline industry while effectively ushering in the jet age of air travel. #OnThisDay in 1957, the first Boeing 707 took flight on a rainy day from Renton Municipal Airport in Washington. N708PA, the aircraft that took this first test flight, pictured here, was delivered to Pan American World Airways on November 30, 1958. Did you ever fly on a 707?
