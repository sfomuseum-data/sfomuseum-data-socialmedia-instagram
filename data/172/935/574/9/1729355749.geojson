        "body": "In his ongoing series, “Solar Transit”, Bryant Austin makes photographs that reveal the sun’s surface in vivid detail while documenting its apparent transit across the California landscape. His process is complex and often requires the use of three separate telescopes equipped with infrared cameras, and a monochrome video camera with scientific lens filters. Seen through the lens of his telescopes, the sun’s presence is heightened and its connection with the landscape becomes tangible—offering us a poignant reminder of our place in the universe, and of a reality that operates on a much larger timescale.  See ”Solar Transit” by #BryantAustin, on display pre-security on the departures level of Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2rko9Jf",
