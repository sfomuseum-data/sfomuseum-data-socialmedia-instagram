        "body": "The Pan American Airways Marine Air Terminal on Dinner Key in the Coconut Grove section of Miami, Florida was considered a milestone of design in commercial aviation history when it opened in 1934. The building served as Pan American’s base for operations throughout the Caribbean, Central, and South America. As landplanes became more widely used, Pan American eventually moved all operations to its 36th Street airfield, now Miami International Airport. In 1954, the City of Miami converted the Dinner Key building into its City Hall, and the Pan American Airways winged-globe logo can still be found on the building’s façade.
