        "body": "After graduating from Colorado College in 1989, Margaret Kilgallen moved to San Francisco, where she fell into orbit with a loose group of artists that would later become known as the Mission School. She worked as a conservator at the San Francisco Public Library and was an avid surfer and bike-rider. Killgallen had a keen interest in the literary arts, typography, hand-lettering, print-making, sign painting, hobo culture, and folk art. Touchstones in her work are the monikers and images that stand in for the unsung heroines of overlooked subcultures, women whose triumphs were on the fringes of the mainstream. “Untitled” by Margaret Kilgallen, is on display, post-security, in Terminal 1.
