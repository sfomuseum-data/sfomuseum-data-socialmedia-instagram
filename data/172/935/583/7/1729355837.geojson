        "body": "BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation) launched Boeing 747 widebody transatlantic service in April 1971 between London and New York. The 747 offered the airline a far more comfortable, roomy, and luxurious option compared to the narrow-body Vickers VC10, which had been in service since 1964. It also had a capacity that was more than double that of the VC10 or the Boeing 707. This was particularly important for the high demand in seats during the summer tourist season. In an advertisement, BOAC proclaimed, “you will hardly believe you're in an aircraft” and described the jumbojet’s interior as “very like a cinema auditorium,” yet with larger seats and superior food. The airline also touted the unique upstairs first-class lounge. Did you ever fly on a BOAC 747? “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
