I thought, 'It's better than I ever dreamed.' - Gilbert Baker (1951-2017)  Did you know the #rainbowflag was created right here in San Francisco in 1978? To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the flag's creation, SFO Museum is presenting an exhibition about Gilbert Baker, the flag's creator featuring a flag created by Baker for the ABC television miniseries When We Rise in 2016. The sewing machine and table on display were also used by Gilbert Baker in the show's production.  See \"#ALegacyOfPride: #GilbertBaker and the 40th Anniversary of the #RainbowFlag\" on view pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/RainbowFlagSFO",
