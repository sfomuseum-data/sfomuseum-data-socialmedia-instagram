        "body": "For inflight meal service, Jean Louis created this serving smock in a vivid geometric pattern with the letter U for United. Both fashionable and functional in reversible black and white, the smock is made of a double-faced polyester weave and has an attached matching belt. The jumper-style dress underneath the smock is paired with the white polyester short sleeve body-suit blouse with mock turtleneck. After this collection, considered a successful new direction in company attire and worn from 1970 until 1972, Louis continued to be United’s designer of choice for the airline’s next mix-and-match wardrobe.
