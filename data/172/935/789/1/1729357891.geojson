In partnership with the San Francisco - Kiel Sister City Committee, SFO Museum is proud to present an exhibition of event posters celebrating Kiel’s annual regatta. The Kiel Week (German: Kieler Woche) is a sailing event that takes place annually in the city and surrounding waters. Since 1948, an annual Kieler Woche poster has been produced for promotional use during the festival week. Forty-four of the festival’s seventy-one winning designs are exhibited at six locations in Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 from June through August, 2018. http://bit.ly/2unUsER",
