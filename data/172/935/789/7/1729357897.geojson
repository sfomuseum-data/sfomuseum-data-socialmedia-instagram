        "body": "The Douglas DC-3 was one of the first airliners to be equipped with a galley. It had upper and lower level storage cabinets for hot and cold meals and a serving counter with a drain. A folding seat and a phone to provide communication with the pilot were also offered. Meals on day-use flights were usually served with paper or plastic cups and plates to reduce weight. When ceramic dishes were used, they were specifically designed to be light for inflight use. American Airlines offered Airlite China produced by the Onondaga Pottery Company of Syracuse, New York, and flatware resembling the DC-3 forward fuselage made by the International Silver Company",
