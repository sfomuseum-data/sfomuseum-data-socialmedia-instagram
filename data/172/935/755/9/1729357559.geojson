        "body": "\"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is not our only exhibition with silver. Check out this soup tureen with cat handle on lid in our \"Caticons\" exhibitions. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, a householdâ€™s inventory of silver items indicated its wealth and status. Silversmiths experimented with imaginative designs and ignited a Victorian passion for collecting a wide variety of ostentatious silver-plated tableware. Knife rests, cruet holders, napkin rings, tea sets, soup tureens, and egg holders are a sampling of the exhaustive list of silver-plated tableware manufactured during the period. Animal forms and motifs adorned many of these items, and the cat was well represented.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
