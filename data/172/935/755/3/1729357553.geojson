        "body": "The DC-10 was McDonnell Douglas’ first wide-body jetliner. The aircraft incorporated a tri-jet engine configuration with two engines mounted under the wings and one incorporated into the vertical stabilizer assembly. Like those on Boeing’s wide-body 747, the DC-10’s engines were high-bypass turbofans, which were capable of thrusting the aircraft to a maximum cruising speed of just over 600 miles per hour. The aircraft had a capacity of up to 400 passengers and offered similar wide-body spaciousness and comfort to the 747. The DC-10 also featured first-class and coach lounges and a lower deck galley. American Airlines introduced the DC-10-10 series in August 1971. Most international carriers chose the DC-10-30 series due to its extended transoceanic range. UTA introduced the aircraft in 1973, and by the mid-1970s, the carrier was operating it on many of its long-haul transatlantic routes to North and South America.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
