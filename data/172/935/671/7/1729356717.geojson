        "body": "The use of aluminum in airplane airframes was pioneered by Jugo Junkers, who introduced the F 13 in 1920. It was the world’s first all-metal airliner made of the aluminum alloy “Duralumin,” which was corrugated throughout the airframe for added strength. Inspired by Junkers’ designs, William Stout formed the Stout Metal Airplane company in Detroit, Michigan. It was purchased by the Ford Motor Company in 1924. Following the development of the all-aluminum Stout AT-2 and AT-3 airliners, Ford introduced the 4-AT Tri-Motor in 1926, and shortly after, the 5-AT Tri-Motor. The sturdy, all-metal Ford Tri-Motor had a profound impact on the early advancement of commercial aviation in the late 1920s. \"Aluminum: The Miracle Metal of Aviation\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AviationAluminum  Image: Ford 4-AT-E Tri-Motor corrugated leading edge wing and fuselage sections, 1929.
