        "body": "Jacques-Gérard Milbert’s (1776–1840) published lithographs provided the inspiration for the five scenes in Views of North America. Employed as an engineer with the Erie Canal Commission, Milbert also traveled throughout the northeastern United States from 1815 to 1823. Upon returning to France, Milbert published “Picturesque Itinerary of the Hudson River and the Peripheral Parts of North America” in 1828 and 1829, a 569-page book with fifty-four lithographs. Designer Jean-Julien Deltil (1791–1863) most likely never visited North America. Instead, he drew freely from five of Milbert’s published lithographs to design his fanciful scenic wallpaper, enlivening the scenes to make for pleasant and engaging viewing on the walls of one’s home.  See more stunning scenic wallpaper in “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” on display, pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
