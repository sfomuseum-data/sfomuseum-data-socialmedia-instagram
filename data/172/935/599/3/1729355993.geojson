        "body": "In 1923, Igor Sikorsky founded the Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corporation (later renamed the Sikorsky Manufacturing Company). One of the most important early Sikorsky aircraft, the S-42, was developed to meet the requirements of Pan American Airways’ president Juan T. Trippe for a large, long-range, trans-oceanic flying boat. Designed by Igor Sikorsky, with input from Charles A. Lindbergh, it could carry a crew of four and thirty-two passengers up to 1,200 miles. In 1935, the S-42 named “Pan American Clipper” was modified for extended range to survey the Pacific route and was later used for regular service on the Manila–Hong Kong leg. An S-42B flew South Pacific survey missions.  Learn more about early transpacific aviation in \"China Clipper\" on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/chinaclipper  Image: Pan American Airways, Sikorsky S-42, 1935.
