        "body": "The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 was an updated version of the DC-9, which was introduced in 1965. Swissair introduced the airliner in 1980. Like the DC-9, the MD-80 provided a mid-range, medium capacity airliner capable of serving short runways of small regional airports. The design was highly successful with orders from airlines the world over. American Airlines purchased a large fleet of the airliner and eventually became the world’s largest MD-80 operator. (Currently, Delta Air Lines is the largest operator.) The aircraft proved ideal for the carrier’s many mid-range, regional services during the decades of its operation.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://ow.ly/VsVQ50jV87S",
