        "body": "The Golden Gate Kindergarten Association is a non-profit organization in San Francisco with a dual mission: it operates a preschool for children ages two through five, known as the Phoebe A. Hearst Preschool, and it also holds the Rhoda Kellogg collection of children’s art. The Phoebe A. Hearst Preschool is proudly the oldest preschool program in San Francisco.  Rhoda Kellogg was an early childhood scholar and collector of children’s artwork who served for years as the preschool’s director. Ms. Kellogg amassed an extensive and wide-ranging collection of children’s art—numbering over half a million pieces—through travels in thirty countries around the world and through her work with children at the Phoebe A. Hearst Preschool. The pieces on view in this exhibition represent the breadth and diversity of children’s art held in the Rhoda Kellogg Art Collection.  Art from the \"Phoebe A. Hearst Preschool and Rhoda Kellogg Art Collection\" is on display pre-security, in Terminal 1.  http://bit.ly/2qaEuMr",
