        "body": "Arhoolie Records’ subsidiary label Blues Classics was the first to reintroduce the work of Memphis Minnie (1897–1973) to a new and largely white audience. A highly influential blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter, Minnie was born in Louisiana. Her family moved to Walls, Mississippi; the singer ran away to nearby Memphis in her early teens and got her start playing the guitar for tips on city streets. The tough, street-smart Minnie enjoyed a successful career performing and recording for various blues labels beginning in the 1920s and continuing well into the 1950s. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
