        "body": "The Douglas DC-8 was developed during the mid-1950s as a competitive design to Boeing’s 707. United Air Lines chose the Douglas DC-8 and launched domestic transcontinental jet service with the DC-8-10 series in September 1959. Soon after, United DC-8s were providing jet service across the 2,400 mile expanse of the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to Hawai’i. Originally delivered as a DC-8-12 in October 1959, “Mainliner William B. Stout” was later converted to a DC-8-51, which included the replacement of its original turbojet engines with more economical turbofan engines. Although initially less successful as a commercial passenger jetliner than the Boeing design, the DC-8 outlasted the 707. Moreover, many freighter versions are still in operation.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions . . .",
