        "body": "Lillian Palmer (1871–1961), undeterred by a lack of formal training, began crafting metalwork in copper, lead, and brass in 1907. Her style exudes an unmistakably feminine quality that distinguishes her work from her contemporaries. After several years of studying metal crafting and design for electrified objects in Vienna, Japan, and Chicago, Palmer opened The Palmer Copper Shop in San Francisco in 1910. Palmer focused on making electric lamps and lighting fixtures, still a novelty at the time at The Palmer Copper Shop. Metal became scarce with the onset of World War I; by 1917, Palmer had no choice but to close her shop. She returned to metalwork after the war and in 1932 moved with her lifelong companion, architect Emily E. Williams (1869–1942) to Los Gatos, California.  Lamps courtesy of Caro Macpherson.
