        "body": "Miniatures of the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, and those of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, were popular with visitors to these familiar ruins in Rome’s Forum. The earliest versions date to the first part of the 19th century, when archaeological excavations of these temples revealed much of their current forms. Thus, while we consider these places as ancient, it was their novelty that spurred the production of souvenirs.  All objects are from the Collection of Piraneseum. See \"All Roads Lead to #Rome: 17th–19th Century Architectural Souvenirs from the Collection of #Piraneseum\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AllRoadsRome ",
