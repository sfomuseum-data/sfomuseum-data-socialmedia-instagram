        "body": "In the 1970s, Pan American World Airways offered meal service to passengers in upper deck first class cabin of Boeing 747.  Introduced by Pan American World Airways in 1970, the Boeing 747-100 was the first of a new breed of jetliner, the “wide-body,” which ultimately revolutionized the airline industry. The 747 main cabin was wide enough to seat ten abreast and could carry up to 450 passengers. It featured a distinctive pod above the main cabin that formed the flight deck and a unique first-class lounge. Like the earlier 377 Stratocruiser, the lounge was accessed by a spiral staircase from the main cabin. It became one of the central showpieces in airline introductory promotions, and unlike earlier lounges, which usually had a standard layout, the 747 lounge could be configured in a variety of designs. Many carriers also initially included a large coach lounge in the airliner’s main cabin. Did you ever enjoy a meal in the upper deck of a #PanAm Boeing 747?
