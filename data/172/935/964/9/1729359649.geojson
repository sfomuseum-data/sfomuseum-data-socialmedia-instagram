Signaling a return to the comfort of romantic traditionalism, this simple yet elegant short sleeve shirt dress is in a light celery green polyester quatrefoil print that incorporates the UTA brand. The company logo is repeated on the false buckle of the partial leather belt and accompanying blue wool cardigan.  See \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
