        "body": "A wide range of gambling devices employed dice that were “tossed” under glass domes. Although later machines offered awards based on reading the dice to achieve high poker hands or to simulate craps, most of those made at the turn of the twentieth century were simple devices that paid on the dice totals, usually from five to thirty. A nickel-playing fortune teller offered predictions and advice with the cash payout, including one dollar awarded for five of a kind, and the admonition—“Thirst not after riches, they will prove destructive.” All objects are courtesy of Joe Welch American Antique Museum in San Bruno, California. See \"#GamesofChance: Gambling Devices of the Mechanical Age\" and our accompanying photography show, \"The American Saloon: Historical Photographs from the Collection of Roger E. Kislingbury\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/GamesofChance ",
