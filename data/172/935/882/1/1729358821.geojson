        "body": "Fraktur, or illuminated Germanic documents, employ a combination of ink and watercolor and can be easily recognized by its elaborate decoration. These documents typically display bright colors with intricate lines and flourishes, such as birds, hearts, flowers, and figures. One of the birds depicted in this fraktur is the Carolina parakeet, North Americaâ€™s only parrot species, which became extinct in 1939. Highly illustrative, fraktur influenced many other forms of Pennsylvania German folk art.  Fraktur courtesy of the collection of the Landis Valley Village and Farm Museum, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
