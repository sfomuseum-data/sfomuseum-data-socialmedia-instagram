        "body": "Happy Birthday, California! Today we celebrate California’s admittance into the union #onthisday in 1850. “California Studio Craft: featuring works from the Forrest L. Merrill collection” presents studio craft from various California craft makers. In the 1960s, California was promoted as a progressive and fertile proving ground for studio craft. Working with various materials including clay, fiber, wood, metal, and glass, studio craft makers pioneered new directions in their respective media through innovative applications of traditional techniques. With the support of college programming, exhibitions, and a burgeoning consumer market, makers utilized an artistic focus that bound craft more closely to the fine arts. A revolutionary studio craft movement emerged, characterized by creativity, optimism, and new dimensions. As the scene expanded around Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area, other cities throughout the nation took notice.  See \"California Studio Craft: Featuring Works from the Forrest L. Merrill Collection\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/CaliforniaCrafts",
