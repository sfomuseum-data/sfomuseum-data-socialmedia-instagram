We’re preparing for our newest exhibition, “Flying The Freedom Birds: Airlines And The Vietnam War.” For the Vietnam generation of U.S. military veterans, the phrase Freedom Bird, meant one thing; the aircraft that brought them home at the end of their tours. However, these were not military aircraft, but commercial airliners served by civilian crews and flight attendants. Featuring extensive interviews with key participants of these operations, along with their uniforms and keepsake objects, this exhibition provides insight into their experiences serving aboard the Freedom Birds. Stay tuned for more behind the scenes from the museum!",
