Rojas intends to bring a sense of warmth and comfort to the viewer, and she often changes the exhibition space to better fit the feeling of her work. Here she transforms the gate room wall into space more reminiscent of home. Blue Deer is based on a childrenâ€™s book Rojas wrote and illustrated, Blue Deer and Red Fox.  See \"Blue Deer\" by Clare Rojas, post-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/2oSr60h",
