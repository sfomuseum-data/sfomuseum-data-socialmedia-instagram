Even in the late forties when this Packard advertisement was produced, Clipper was still a name companies wanted to be associated with. “Two star performers: the globe-girdling Pan American Clipper and the beautiful new Packard Clipper.” Image:  Pan American World Airways, Packard advertisement, late 1940s.
