        "body": "Developed behind the Iron Curtain by the Tupolev Design Bureau during the late 1950s, the massive Tu-114 Rossiya (Russia) turboprop airliner was introduced by the Soviet national airline Aeroflot in 1961. With a range of nearly 4,000 miles and a capacity of up to 220 passengers, the Tu-114 was an ideal aircraft for Aeroflot's long-distance domestic routes throughout the vast territories of the U.S.S.R, as well as international flights to Europe and transatlantic flights to North America and Cuba. In 1967, Tu-114 service was initiated to Japan under an agreement with Japan Air Lines in which the two airlines shared flight crew duties. Aeroflot operated the Tu-114 until the 1970s.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display pre-security in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
