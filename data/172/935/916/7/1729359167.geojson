Upon completion, over 2,000 employees began work at the 116-acre “SFOMB.” For its efficiency, the modern facility earned the nicknames “the push-button base” and “the airline house of magic.” A United Douglas DC-3 would undergo a complete teardown and overhaul after 1,300 hours of flying. The base averaged a turnout of one completely overhauled Mainliner every thirty-six hours.
