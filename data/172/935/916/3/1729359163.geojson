        "body": "Gustav Stickley (1858–1942), leading proponent of the American Arts and Crafts movement in the United States, was born to first-generation, German-immigrant parents in Wisconsin. Stickley established a business with his brothers before founding his own furniture business, the Gustav Stickley Company, in Syracuse, New York, in 1898. Although Stickley is largely known for the oak furniture he created, he also offered metalwork and textiles. Stickley’s textiles for Arts and Crafts interiors ranged from embroidered, appliquéd, and stenciled table scarves to wall hangings, curtains, pillows, and bedspreads. Rather than drape entire surfaces with fabric, a common practice at the time, Arts and Crafts designers, including Stickley, encouraged people to drape single table scarves off-center across dining tables, which brightened austere wooden surfaces. Library tables, sideboards, and chests of drawers were also draped with scarves.  Table scarf courtesy of Dianne Ayres \u0026 Tim Hanson - Arts \u0026 Crafts Period Textiles.
