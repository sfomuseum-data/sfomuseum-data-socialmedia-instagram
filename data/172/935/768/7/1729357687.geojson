        "body": "In an effort to compete with TWA (Trans World Airlines) on transatlantic routes to Europe, Pan American World Airways ordered the extended-range DC-7C (dubbed the “Seven Seas”) from Douglas Aircraft. Developed from the earlier DC-6B transcontinental airliner, it included upgraded engines, increased fuel capacity, and greater wingspan, all of which gave it slightly better range and speed compared to TWA’s Lockheed 1049 Super Constellation. Promoted as the “Super Seven,” Pan Am introduced the airliner in May 1956, on the Atlantic route from Miami to Paris, and in September 1957, on the time-saving, transpolar “great circle route,” across the Arctic Ocean to Northern Europe. It could comfortably seat up to eighty-four passengers and was mostly operated in a tourist class configuration, while the Boeing 377 was reserved for premium class operations. Many regular business travelers chose the DC-7C over the Boeing 377 simply because it saved at least one hour on most transatlantic routes.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
