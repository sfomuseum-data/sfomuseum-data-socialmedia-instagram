This winter suit, worn from 1963 to 1968, is made in soft bouclé worsted wool created in a new color named Blue Vision. Distinctly more feminine than previous fitted-suit uniforms, the modified box-shape jacket with a bracelet length sleeve and a soft rolled collar is matched with an A-line skirt. Do you remember this uniform?  Image: United Air Lines, DiAnn (Marcus) Bormes, stewardess instructor [digital scan], 1966. Gift of DiAnn Bormes. 2015.110.019",
