Radio was also utilized as an informational resource, perhaps no more eloquently than by Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945). Beginning on March 12, 1933, the president embarked on a series of Sunday-evening “Fireside Chats” produced in an informal, yet comforting manner on a variety of current events. As the United States entered the Second World War, listeners were riveted to their radios during on-the-spot reporting networked from locations in Europe by newscasters such as Edward R. Murrow (1908–65). By the end of the war, Americans relied on the airwaves for their news. “We are now in this war. We are all in it—all the way. Every single man, woman, and child is a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of our American history. We must share together the bad news and the good news, the defeats and the victories—the changing fortunes of war.” —Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Fireside Chat, December 9, 1941 \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
