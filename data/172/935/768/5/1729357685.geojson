        "body": "As cats gained popularity as pets in Europe during the 1600s, they appeared more frequently in art and on decorative items. Cat motifs are among the many designs applied to delftware and faience pottery. During the 17th century, Dutch artisans from the town of Delft introduced earthenware that imitated the more expensive porcelain imported from China. Known as delftware, these tin-glazed ceramics featured opaque, tin-oxide enamels and lavish decoration.  See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
