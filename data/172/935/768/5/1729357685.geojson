Cat motifs are among the many designs applied to delftware and faience pottery. During the 17th century, Dutch artisans from the town of Delft introduced earthenware that imitated the more expensive porcelain imported from China. Known as delftware, these tin-glazed ceramics featured opaque, tin-oxide enamels and lavish decoration.  See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
