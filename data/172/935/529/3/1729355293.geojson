        "body": "The speed of the advancement of aviation in the twentieth century is aptly illustrated in this image from the late 1950s. The small plane is the Douglas World Cruiser “New Orleans”, one of two airplanes that completed the first flight around the world in 1924, a trip that took 175 days (and began with four planes). It’s nestled against the wing of a Boeing 707, which Pan Am used to inaugurate scheduled round-the-world travel in 2 1/2 days. At the time of this publicity photo, the “New Orleans” was displayed at the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson A.F.B., and while on a showing in New York, it made a detour to stop by New York International Airport (now JFK) to pose for this photo of two pioneers from two very different eras of global circumnavigation by air.  Want to learn more about the New Orleans? It’s now in the collection of the Museum of Flying and you can read about its historic adventure on their website: https://www.museumofflying.org/explore/aircraft/douglas-world-cruiser-new-orleans-4/  Image: Pan American World Airways, Boeing 707, c. 1959.
