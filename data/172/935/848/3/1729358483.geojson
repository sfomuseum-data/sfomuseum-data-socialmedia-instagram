The left panel, Bay Area Victorian, portrays the style and ornamentation of old houses in several San Francisco districts. The right panel, Bay Area Deco, refers to the architecture of downtown Oakland in its heyday, and the center panel Bay Area Funk, is a collection of Berkeley memorabilia from the 1960s. Do you see any of your favorite Bay Area icons?  See \"Bay Area Victorian, Bay Area Deco, Bay Area Funk\" by Joyce Kozloff on display, pre-security, in the Terminal 1 connector. http://bit.ly/2F7dtPQ",
