        "body": "Porcelain was not only admired for its beauty, but also for its durability and pure-white color. China first developed porcelain during the Tang dynasty (618–907). During the tenth century, Korean potters learned the craft, though it was not until the early fifteenth century that large-scale porcelain production began. In 1592 and 1598, Japan invaded Korea. This period of hostility is often referred to as the “Potters’ Wars\" because the Japanese captured several Korean potters and brought them back to southern Japan where they introduced the Japanese to porcelain manufacturing techniques. Production techniques developed rapidly during the early part of the Edo period (1615–1868). By the 1640s, the Japanese began to successfully compete with Chinese porcelain exports.  This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum. \"Maneki Neko: Japanese Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
