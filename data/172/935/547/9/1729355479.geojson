A deteriorating Egyptian temple depicts Africa; while Asia is represented by the Bosporus River and a building reminiscent of the Hagia Sofia; a fertile staircase overlooking an Italian lake paints a romantic picture of Europe; verdant flora, remote mountains, and a view of the Veracruz region of Mexico represent North America. Can you imagine this beautiful wallpaper in your home? “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” is on display, pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
