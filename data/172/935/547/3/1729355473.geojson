        "body": "The work of Nigerian photographer Andrew Esiebo is featured in our exhibition ”Extra ’O’!African Barbershop and Hairdressing Signs.” Based in Nigeria, Andrew Esiebo (b. 1978) is a visual storyteller who began his career in photography by chronicling the rapid development of urban Nigeria as well as the country’s rich culture and heritage. As his career progressed, Esiebo began to explore new creative territory, including themes ranging from popular culture to gender politics, sexuality, and migration. “His Pride” photographic essay explores male hair barbing throughout major West African cities. His photographs document a variety of hairstyles and artfully detail the spaces in which barbers operate. “Extra ’O’! African Barbershop and Hairdressing Signs” is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Extrao . . . #ExtraO #Africa #AfricanBarbershop #AfricanHairdessing #hair #hairstyles",
