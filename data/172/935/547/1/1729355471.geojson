        "body": "International Women’s Day is on Sunday! But why limit ourselves to just one day or just one woman? We’re getting a jump start this year to highlight Ruth Kitchel Wakeman (1907-89), a founding member and the first chairperson of the Illinois Chapter of the Ninety-Nines. She learned how to fly in 1929 while working as a journalist. She even got her husband hooked on flying; he started flying lessons in 1934. In February of 1935, she and her husband moved to San Francisco. This photo, taken at San Francisco Airport in 1940, shows that Ruth’s dedication to aviation continued after her move to San Francisco.
