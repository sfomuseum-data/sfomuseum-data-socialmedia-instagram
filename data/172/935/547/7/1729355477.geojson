        "body": "The first Boeing 747 SP (Special Performance) was delivered to Pan American World Airways #onthisday in 1976. The 747 SP was actually a smaller version of the 747 designed to have extra-long range and the ability to fly non-stop with a full payload from New York to Tokyo. The aircraft could comfortably fly the 6,754 miles between the two cities while carrying 233 passengers in mixed class. The ability to fly the thirteen- or fourteen-hour flight and cross not only the continental U.S. but also the Pacific Ocean was a huge feat at the time. Did you ever fly on a Boeing 747 SP?
