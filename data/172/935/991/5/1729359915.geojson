        "body": "The East India Company, an English company that formed in order to trade with China, Southeast Asia, and India, granted Thomas Daniell and his teenage nephew permission to journey to India to work as engravers in late 1784. Their trip included a stopover in China, since direct passages to India were difficult to secure. At the time, China was just beginning to open up to the West. During their voyage to #Canton (#Guangzhou), they recorded the sites and scenes they saw along the way. They published a book of their illustrations titled \"A #Picturesque Voyage to #India by the Way of #China\" in 1810. These novel images provided subject matter for #Staffordshire potteries to use on their wares.",
