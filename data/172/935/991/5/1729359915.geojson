Their trip included a stopover in China, since direct passages to India were difficult to secure. At the time, China was just beginning to open up to the West. During their voyage to #Canton (#Guangzhou), they recorded the sites and scenes they saw along the way. They published a book of their illustrations titled \"A #Picturesque Voyage to #India by the Way of #China\" in 1810. These novel images provided subject matter for #Staffordshire potteries to use on their wares.",
