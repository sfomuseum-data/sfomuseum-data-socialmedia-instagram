In his series of black-and-white photographs titled \"Carta I\", Cornelis employs dramatic lighting on elaborate and graceful folds to explore the depth of the material and reveal its sculptural quality. Abstract forms emerge from the paperâ€™s reflection and absorption of light, pushing past the edges of his compositions and implying a limitless pattern of interwoven light and shadow.",
