        "body": "Parkside Intermediate School serves sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students in the San Bruno Park School District. Approximately 900 students attend Parkside on a daily basis and participate in a variety of required coursework and elective programs, including art. Parkside believes that every child, given a balanced educational foundation in a safe and risk-free environment, will grow to be a successful and independent member of their community. This fall, seventh and eighth grade students were inspired by Edvard Munch and his famous painting, \"The Scream\" (1893). Students used oil pastels to create works based on Munchâ€™s paintings, paying attention to composition and color palettes. The seventh and eighth grade students also enjoyed working on a foil relief project. Students constructed an abstract design with glue, then covered the art with foil and refined their artwork by adding color and contrast with permanent marker. The final three panels were created by eighth grade advanced art students. The students learned about symmetry, design, and the color wheel, and produced works using analogous colors or mixing tertiary colors.",
