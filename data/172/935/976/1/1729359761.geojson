        "body": "The last Continental flight departed #onthisday in 2012. Leaving Phoenix, AZ as Continental 1267, the flight landed as United 1267 in Cleveland, OH. Continental Airlines began as Varney Speed Lines in 1934 and claimed to be the “Fastest Airline In The World.” The airline changed its name to Continental Air Lines in 1937.  When Continental became an international carrier in 1968, it launched a new corporate identity. An oval, defined in spreading jet contrails, and an updated typeface communicated its new global status and market position. “Contrails Red” became the predominant color, while gold, orange, and black were retained as secondary colors. In 1991, a blue, white, and gold livery was introduced and continued to be used after the #United merger. The blue and gold Continental livery is shown here on a Boeing 767 at LAX.
