This United Air Lines Service Center at SFO was built in 1958 and designed by Myron Goldsmith during his time at SOM. A student of famed architects Mies van der Rohe and Pier Luigi Nervi, one of Goldsmith's first major projects was this hangar for United Air Lines, which was designed to hold four Douglas DC-8 jetliners. SOM has not only designed many buildings around the world including the Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) in Chicago, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and the new One World Trade Center in New York City, but they also had a major role in the design of the International Terminal at SFO.
