At the drop of a coin, they vended goods, provided entertainment, and offered potential jackpot payouts and free merchandise. These intriguing devices incorporated decorative graphics and innovative mechanisms that captured the attention of people worldwide. Installed on store counters and in saloons, hotels, amusement arcades, and other public places, coin-operated machines generated revenue from clientele and passersby with minimal supervision and maintenance.
