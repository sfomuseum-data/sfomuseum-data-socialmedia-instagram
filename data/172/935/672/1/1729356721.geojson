        "body": "Theresa Nguyen is a designer-silversmith who is fascinated by the process of transforming an ordinary sheet of silver into a lifelike, sculptural form. Nguyen, a graduate of the Birmingham City School of Jewellery and the post-graduate workshop at Bishopsland Educational Trust, designs and creates nature-inspired silver at her studio in Birmingham. In 2011, Nguyen created her Spiritus centerpiece, shown here, for an exhibition at the Goldsmiths’ Company in London. The fold-formed piece explored the artist’s perception of containment. To gather source material, Nguyen traveled to many of England’s most renowned gardens, sketching foliage and observing the manner in which plant life unfolds and reaches towards the sun.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
