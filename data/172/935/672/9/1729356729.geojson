The 377, named the #Stratocruiser, was Boeing's first post-war commercial aircraft and was designed as a luxurious, long-range commercial airliner. Its spacious cabin could accommodate up to 100 passengers, depending on the seating configuration. It also featured a lower deck lounge, complete with a cocktail bar. The cost per airplane was $1.2 million at the time, or nearly $17 million today. Did you ever fly on a #Stratocruiser?  Image: Pan American World Airways, Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, 1949.
