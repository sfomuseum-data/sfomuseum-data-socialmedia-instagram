Here you can see Cathay Pacific’s first plane, a Douglas C-47, the military designation for the DC-3, nicknamed “Betsy” with the call letters, VR-HDB. Betsy served the airline from 1946 to 1955, and then was sold as the airline modernized its fleet. Betsy was found delivering cargo in the Australian outback in the 1980s, lovingly restored to her 1940s livery, and is now on display in the Hong Kong Science Museum. Have you ever been to Hong Kong?   Image: Cathay Pacific Airways, Douglas DC-3, c. 1946. Gift of Cathay Pacific Airways. 1994.20.06",
