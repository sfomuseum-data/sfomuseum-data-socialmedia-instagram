In 2016, we presented “A Modern Approach: Mid-Century Design,” which featured mid-century studio art, graphic design, and manufactured goods from the 1930s to the 1960s. The form of each object followed its function, with innovative construction methods finished in natural tones and bold colors. Do you remember this exhibition? https://bit.ly/2RwSWfm",
