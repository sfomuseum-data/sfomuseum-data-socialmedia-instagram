        "body": "Jet streams are fast flowing westerly (moving west to east) air currents found around the world. Located in the tropopause, the layer of the atmosphere just below the stratosphere, jet streams are used in the aviation industry to shorten flying time all over the world. Ever wonder why jets frequently travel polar routes? In addition to covering a shorter distance, west to east routes may take advantage of the jet stream to further shorten flying time. Jet streams are located from 30,000 to 56,000 feet above the surface of the Earth and form at the boundaries of warm air and cold air. The strong winds, up to 200 miles an hour, are formed because of the pressure variations between the two temperatures of air. Because of the earth's rotation, the jet stream, does not move in a straight line.  In November 1952, Captain Logan Scott, piloting a Pan American World Airways Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, made history by following these fast-flowing winds. Taking off from Tokyo, Japan bound for Honolulu, Hawaii, this flight flew non-stop for 3,908 miles and shaved off seven hours of flying time using the jet stream.
