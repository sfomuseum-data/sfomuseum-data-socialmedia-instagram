        "body": "Television quickly surpassed radio as the most popular media in the United States during the 1950s. At the beginning of the decade, approximately one in ten households owned a television. By 1960, at least one TV set was installed in nearly ninety percent of American homes. Portable TV sets brought television to a wider audience. Compact and more affordable than heavier, full-size models, portable televisions could be transported to various rooms of the home with relative ease. In the mid-1950s, personal portable sets incorporated miniature tubes and became even smallerâ€”however, they still required household voltage to operate. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
