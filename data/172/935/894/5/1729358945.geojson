        "body": "In 1945, Ada Brown became the first President of the earliest recognized flight attendant union, the Air Line Stewardess Association (ALSA). In 1947, Ada, at the age of 30, was let go from both her job at United Air Lines and her position in the ALSA because she decided to marry.  During a time when women could be dismissed from their jobs as stewardesses or hostesses if they became pregnant, got married, or turned 36, the ALSA fought for women's rights. Women had to adhere to strict regulations to keep their flight attendant positions. The ALSA helped to change the working conditions for female cabin crew professionals. American flight attendants are no longer bound by strict regulations monitoring their marital status, family status, or age. The ALSA exists now as the Association of Flight Attendants â€“ CWA.
