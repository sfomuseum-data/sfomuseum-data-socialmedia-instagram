        "body": "Part of the Stuart L. Udall Foundation, the Parks in Focus program connects middle school youth from underserved communities to nature and National Parks through photography, environmental education, and outdoor learning. During the summer months, Parks in Focus leads three five-day camping trips to the area, providing thirty-six Bay Area youth with the opportunity to visit, explore, and photograph Yosemite for the first time. Over the course of each trip, participants learn about Yosemite’s natural and cultural history as well as the importance of our National Parks. This summer, they worked together on several important stewardship projects and challenged themselves with a sunset hike to the top of Sentinel Dome. Inspired by the wonders of Yosemite’s outdoor classroom and the area’s rich photographic history, participants produce images of their adventures, and the flora, fauna, and topography they encounter along the way.  See \"Yosemite in Focus\" by the participants of Parks in Focus on display, pre-security, in the arrivals level of Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2y8BKpj",
