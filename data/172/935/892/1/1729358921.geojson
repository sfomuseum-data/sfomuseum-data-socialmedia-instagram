        "body": "Qantas, an acronym for \"Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services\", was founded on November 16, 1920. The flag carrier of Australia, Qantas is the third oldest airline in the world. The company's original mascot, the kangaroo, was adapted from the Australian one penny coin. In 1947, the kangaroo was redesigned by Sydney designer Gert Sellheim with wings. The company decided in 1984 to update their logo again and the kangaroo lost its wings to become a more stylized rendition of a kangaroo, which is still featured on their aircraft today. Have you ever flown on Qantas?  Image: Qantas Airways postcard, Boeing 747-200B, c. 1975. Gift of George Gayuski. 2001.082.059",
