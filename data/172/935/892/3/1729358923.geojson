        "body": "Theatricalizing life with dreams\" was how Mary Wells, a pioneering advertising executive for Jack Tinker Associates, recalled her greatest strength. Her dream for Braniff International in 1965 was an experience that was fun, youthful, and fashion-forward. It was an experience that started with the advertising and was carried straight through the ticket counters and airport lounges and onto the colorful aircraft served by air hostesses in radically designed uniforms. Launched in the midst of the creative, rebellious 1960s, the campaign was a runaway success. Almost overnight, Wellâ€™s campaign transformed Braniff International from a respectably conservative, mid-sized Texas airline to an international icon of American youthful creativity and prosperity that captured the age like no other campaign had done before. Her success with Braniff International gave Wells the professional clout to start her own agency, Wells, Rich, Greene, in 1966. When the company went public in 1968, Mary Wells became the first female CEO of a company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. \"When You Got it- Flaunt It: #AdvertisingBraniff International\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/AdvertisingBraniff",
