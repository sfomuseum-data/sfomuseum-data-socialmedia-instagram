        "body": "Radio is one of the great technological triumphs of the 20th century. Envisioned for wireless communication, radio became a universal mass media and captivated audiences around the world. For the first time in history, populations separated by thousands of miles could be notified of important news at a momentâ€™s notice. In the United States, radio programming shaped popular culture and strengthened national unity. Millions of Americans gathered around their radios every night during the 1930s and 1940s to hear live comedies, serials, musical performances, and news reports. Radio was the most exciting and accessible technology of its time and galvanized the imagination of countless listeners. What are your favorite memories about the radio? \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
