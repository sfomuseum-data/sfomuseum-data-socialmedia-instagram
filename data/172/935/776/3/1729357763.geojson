        "body": "At the end of World War II, the French aircraft manufacturer Breguet began designing a large-capacity, mid-range airliner that would ultimately become the four-engine, double-deck 763 Provence. The design featured a cantilevered wing mounted midway on a unique fish-shaped fuselage with a double tail. The cabin had a capacity for fifty-nine tourist-class passengers on the upper deck and forty-eight second-class passengers on the lower. It could also carry a combination of passengers on the upper deck and cargo on the lower deck, loaded through aft clamshell doors. Air France ordered twelve of the aircraft, which entered service in 1953, and were operated on routes to Algiers and Southern Europe for carrying both passengers and freight.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
