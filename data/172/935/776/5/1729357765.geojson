The harshness of electricity is thus transformed through the magic of paper back to the light of our origin—the sun—so that its warmth may continue to fill our rooms at night.” - Isamu Noguchi, November 17, 1981 Thank you to The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum for their generous loan. See \"Isamu Noguchi: Inside and Out\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/NoguchiSFO",
