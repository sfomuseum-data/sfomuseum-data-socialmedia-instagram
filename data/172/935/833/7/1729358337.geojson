        "body": "Patriotic folk artists have long depicted the American flag on a variety of objects. In 1818, Congress passed an act declaring that the flag must have thirteen stripes, with stars added for new states but provided no specifications as to how the stars should be arranged. Twenty-eight stars were added to the flag between 1818 and 1912. With no regulations, flags appeared with stars positioned in all manner of variations. Finally, in 1912, President William Howard Taft established the standard pattern of stars that remains today.
