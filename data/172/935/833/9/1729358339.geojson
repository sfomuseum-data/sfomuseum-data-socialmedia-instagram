        "body": "Developed from the 367 Stratofreighter, the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser was a fast, pressurized, large capacity airliner. Following its introduction in 1949, brochures and advertisements promoted its exceedingly smooth ride, its large, roomy, upper deck, and, in particular, the Stratocruiser's unique and luxurious lower-deck lounge. Conceived by Walter Dorwin Teague, the lounge was accessed by a spiral staircase, had wrap-around, sofa-style seating for up to fourteen, and included a small bar. Often regarded as \"the queen of the skies,\" the Stratocruiser became a favorite with passengers due in great part to its lounge.
