        "body": "Émile Gallé (1846-1904) combined natural motifs with modern techniques and was one of Art Nouveau’s most significant figures. World renowned for his exquisite art glass, Gallé’s firm also produced ceramic and wooden items, often with the cat as his subject. Life-sized ceramic sculptures are his most famous feline creations and are simply referred to as Gallé cats. Made from faience, a tin-glazed earthenware, they feature colorful, whimsical designs and glass eyes colored by green sulfur. Gallé cats are prized for their magnetic smiles, and some include a locket framing a humorous picture of a dog.  See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
