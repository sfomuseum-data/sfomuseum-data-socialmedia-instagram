Leading the Joint Venture Architects group, Skidmore, Owings \u0026 Merrill, envisioned the International Terminal that became a signature structure at SFO. With 24 additional gates and 2.5 million square feet, the International Terminal doubled the overall passenger terminal square footage. Have you ever flown out of our International Terminal?
