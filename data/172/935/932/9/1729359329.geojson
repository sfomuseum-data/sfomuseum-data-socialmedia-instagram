The Eastern Air Lines Douglas DC-3 could travel up to 200 mph and was promoted by the airline as clean, fast, and restful, with a quiet cabin. By the looks of this c. 1940 postcard, the passengers on this small plane are enjoying their meals and the view out of the large windows. And of interest to modern-day air travelers, check out the train-like overhead compartments!  Image:  Eastern Air Lines postcard, Douglas, c. 1940. Gift of Thomas G. Dragges. 2015.166.0636",
