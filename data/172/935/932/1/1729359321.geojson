        "body": "In the pioneering early days of aviation, mechanics often flew in the right seat of the cockpit and could perform co-pilot duties if needed. A basic tool kit, usually in a canvas roll-up for lightweight portability, was always onboard. A good supply of extra spark plugs was packed for frequent refueling stops, when a quick tune up could ensure that all cylinders were firing.
