        "body": "Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco was commissioned #onthisday in 1940. San Francisco Airport provided 20.53 acres at the mouth of its new man-made seaplane harbor for the Air Station site. In exchange, the federal government dredged and maintained the harbor and its channel to the bay. With a hangar, barracks, and a ramp, the new station was dedicated on February 15, 1941. Operations began with one Consolidated PBY-5 Catalina flying boat. During World War II, the command patrolled the coast and conducted numerous sea-air rescues (SAR).
