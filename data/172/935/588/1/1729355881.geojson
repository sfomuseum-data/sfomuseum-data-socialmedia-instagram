Our exhibition “Flying the Freedom Birds: Airlines and the Vietnam War” highlights the stories of commercial flight crew who were chartered to provide flights for servicemen in and out of combat zones. Despite the intensity of the operations, many flight attendants found the military contract flights rewarding and continued to serve on them for years. “I wouldn’t trade the experience for a million dollars,” stated Julie Kane, a flight attendant for Seaboard World Airlines.  See “Flying the Freedom Birds: Airlines and the Vietnam War,” on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/FreedomBirds",
