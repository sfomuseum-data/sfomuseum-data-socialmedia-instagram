It is through the magic of photography that light becomes the subject matter with colors, forms, and space/time relationships that express my deepest feelings and beliefs.” Wynn Bullock (1902-1975)  To create the images in “Color Light Abstractions”, photographer Wynn Bullock produced an apparatus that held a number of horizontal sheets of clear glass spaced evenly above one another. Upon these, he would place a series of materials—water, shards of stained glass, brightly colored cellophane. By positioning the camera above and manipulating the materials on each layer of glass below, Bullock could precisely compose each frame to create his light abstractions. The resulting scenes were significant not only in their ability to transport the viewer to evocative worlds consisting solely of light and color. “Color Light Abstractions” by #WynnBullock is on display,  post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2oDnQIr",
