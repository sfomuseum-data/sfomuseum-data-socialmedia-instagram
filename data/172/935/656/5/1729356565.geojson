The double decker aircraft has a wingspan of 261 feet (79 meters), nearly the length of a football field! It has a maximum seating capacity of 853 passengers -- though airlines usually have their cabins configured to accommodate around 500 passengers. Emirates has the largest A380 fleet in the world, with 108 aircraft. Have you ever flown on an Airbus A380?  Image: Airbus A380 model aircraft, c. 2005. Gift of David Laudenat. 2012.033.002 a b ",
