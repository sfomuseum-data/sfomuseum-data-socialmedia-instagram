        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1930, Ellen Church began her first shift as the first female cabin crewmember at Boeing Air Transport (BAT). Hired by Boeing’s district manager, Steve Stimpson, in their San Francisco office in 1930, she pioneered the “stewardess” profession and recruited seven more women for hire. The original eight flight attendants were required to be trained nurses as flying could be a precarious undertaking. Their jobs also included weighing passengers and luggage, loading and unloading bags, helping to fuel airplanes, and occasionally pushing the airplane into hangars.
