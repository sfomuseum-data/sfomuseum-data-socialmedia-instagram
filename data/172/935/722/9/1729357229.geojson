        "body": "After submitting drawings, plans, and digital renderings, Rowan Berry (b. 1996) was honored as the 2017 Incorporation of Goldsmiths Outstanding Scottish Student while attending the Glasgow School of Art. The award allowed Berry to create a silver goblet (5) under the tutelage of silversmith and master chaser Michael Lloyd at his workshop in Dumfries and Galloway. Of Berry’s inspiration for the goblet, the artist states she is “inspired by religious, spiritual and personal objects, and the connotations of the simple symbols of the circle and cross. I understand the symbols of the circle and cross to mean many different things in connection to love, religion, luck and faith. I wanted the goblet to have a real sense of being made by hand, and an important part of translating this was using chasing.” Goblet  2017 Rowan Berry (b. 1996) Edinburgh Britannia silver, parcel-gilt Collection of the Incorporation of Goldsmiths of the City of Edinburgh L2018.1801.019  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
