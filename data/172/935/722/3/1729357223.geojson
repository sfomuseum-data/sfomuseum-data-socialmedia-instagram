The minimalist aesthetic of his 1977 uniform launched Braniff New Elegance and Ultra-Touch campaign. Drawing on the success of his Ultrasuede ready-to-wear sportswear lines, Halston used earth tones of light brown, beige, and ivory in polyester suit pieces with tie-belt jacket and H-pattern nylon crepe. The June 1979 graduates of Braniff's school for flight attendants show off the uniform in their class portrait, taken at the company's headquarters at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport.
