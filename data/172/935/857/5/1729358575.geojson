Promoted as the \"Super Seven,\" Pan Am introduced the airliner in May 1956, on the Atlantic route from Miami to Paris, and in September 1957, on the time-saving, transpolar \"great circle route,\" across the Arctic Ocean to Northern Europe. Many of Pan Am's regular business travelers chose the DC-7C over the Boeing 377 simply because it saved at least one hour on most transatlantic routes.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions  Image: Pan American World Airways postcard, Douglas DC-7C, c. 1956.
