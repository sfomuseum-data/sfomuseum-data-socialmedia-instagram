Passenger service started later that year with two eight-passenger Sikorsky S-38s, flying from Honolulu to the other Hawaiian Islands. In 1941, the company changed its name to Hawaiian Airlines and acquired three Douglas DC-3s. Have you ever flown on Hawaiian Airlines?  Image: Hawaiian Airlines postcard, 80th anniversary, 2009.
