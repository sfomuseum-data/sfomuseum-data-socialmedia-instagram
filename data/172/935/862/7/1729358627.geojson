        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1939, Pan American Airways received its first two Boeing 314 flying boats. With spacious passenger lounges and luxurious appointments, the B 314 was called a flying hotel by journalists. Pan Am ordered six of the original and six more B 314A variants. Designed by Woodwell E. Beall, it distinguished itself by sheer size, three vertical stabilizers on its tail, and cantilevered seawings that doubled as fuel tanks. In 1939, it was added to Pan Am's trans-Pacific routes and used to inaugurated trans-Atlantic service. It took a flight crew of up to ten to operate this \"Super Clipper.\" Learn more about #PanAm's flying boats in \"China Clipper\", on display pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal.
