This particular talking board, the Magi-Board, from the 1940s, features a planchette consisting of a wooden cross with a large pointer at its center. Users had to balance the device on their fingertips.  All objects are courtesy of Gene Orlando, Museum of Talking Boards, and Robert Murch, The Talking Board Historical Society.
