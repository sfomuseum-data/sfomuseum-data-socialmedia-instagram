        "body": "It is #InternationalCatDay! Can't get enough cats?! Our exhibition, \"Stepping Out: Shoes in World Culture\" features Chinese children's shoes with Tiger motifs. More than merely decorative, the symbols and motifs found on Chinese clothing and personal adornment usually represent hidden meanings that convey wishes for good fortune. Some of the most frequently given gifts to children in China include handmade embroidered and appliquéd clothing. Tigers, the most popular motif sewn onto children’s items, are meant to frighten spirits and help children grow up to be strong and fearless. Historically, a child wore protective clothing items for several years.  Shoes courtesy of Sally Yu Leung. See more shoes from all over the world in \"Stepping Out: Shoes in World Culture\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ShoesinCulture",
