After a trip to Mexico, she was inspired by looped wire basketry used to store produce and eggs in the marketplace. Asawa combined traditional Mexican wire looping with her line drawing designs and wove complex and flowing three-dimensional hanging mobiles, similar in construction to the egg basket on display here.  See \"California Studio Craft: Featuring Works from the Forrest L. Merrill Collection\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/CaliforniaCrafts",
