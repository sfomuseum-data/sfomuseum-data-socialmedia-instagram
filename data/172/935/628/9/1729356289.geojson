Juan was searching for a stop between Midway Island and Guam for Pan Am’s proposed transpacific route. Wake was one of the islands the United States claimed after the annexation of Hawaii and the seizing of Guam during the Spanish-American War in 1898. When Pan Am was granted rights to use the island from the American government in 1935, the airline set up a hotel with 48 rooms and a village, nicknamed PAAville. Wake was used as a commercial airline stop until the 1970s, when jets began to have longer flight ranges. Now a military outpost for the US Air Force, the island is still used as an airfield and refueling stop.  Image: Pan American World Airways tourist information, Wake Island, 1962. Gift of Jon E.
