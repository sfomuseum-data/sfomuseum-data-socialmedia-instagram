A self-educated craftsman, he honed his woodworking techniques through decades of experience, constantly fine-tuning simple-yet-elegant forms. Stocksdale produced exquisite bowls and plates from an impressive stockpile of exotic materials such as Cambodian boxwood, Sri Lankan ebony (used for this bowl), Nicaraguan cocobolo, and African blackwood.
