        "body": "Coin-operated radios provided an hour of entertainment at the drop of a quarter or dime. Manufactured from the late 1940s into the 1950s, these novel radios are indicative of a bygone era. Following the end of the Second World War, travelers took to their automobiles every weekend in an unprecedented boom in auto tourism. By 1964, more than 61,000 roadside motor hotels, commonly known as motels, dotted Americaâ€™s highways and byways. Reflecting regional themes, modern architecture, and kitschy design, these simply constructed lodgings were marked by illustrative neon signage and offered modest accommodations for the weary traveler. Many motel proprietors installed coin-operated radios in their rooms to maximize profits. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
