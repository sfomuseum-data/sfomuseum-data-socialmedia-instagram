        "body": "During the late 1940s, high-fidelity audio equipment progressed from floor standing, cabinet radios to scientifically designed, component-based systems. By the 1950s, most arrangements included a multi-channel pre-amplifier with volume and tone controls; a high power, low-distortion amplifier; a dynamically balanced, constant-speed turntable; and a Superheterodyne AM-FM tuner. A number of technological improvements made true, high-fidelity sound possible. Reel-to-reel, multi-track studio equipment created recordings that were more complex and lifelike. A handful of radio stations operating on FM, or frequency modulation, broadcast musical programming without the pops and noise associated with AM radio. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
