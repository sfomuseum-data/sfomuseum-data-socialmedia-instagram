        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1964, the #Boeing 727 was introduced by Eastern Air Lines. The Boeing 727 was s a medium range, intermediate-capacity jetliner that featured a clean swept wing, a high horizontal stabilizer, and a unique tri-jet configuration. The only tri-jet to be developed by Boeing, the tri-jet design dictated that the horizontal stabilizer be placed well away from the middle engine, high on top of the vertical stabilizer. During the time of its production from the 1960s to the 1980s it was Boeing's best-selling jet with over 1,800 sold. Have you ever flown on a Boeing 727?  Image: Boeing 727-100, c. 1963.
