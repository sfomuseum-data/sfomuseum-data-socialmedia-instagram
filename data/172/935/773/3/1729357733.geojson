        "body": "The all-metal Ford Tri-Motor, or “Tin Goose,” as it was nicknamed, had a substantial impact on the early advancement of commercial aviation in the late 1920s. The initial 4-AT Tri-Motor was equipped with Wright Whirlwind engines, while the 5-AT was upgraded with more powerful Pratt and Whitney Wasp engines. In 1929, TAT (Transcontinental Air Transport) initiated the first transcontinental air service (combined with train service) with Ford 4-AT Tri-Motors. Most other major American airlines purchased safe and reliable Ford Tri-Motors for their fleets.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
