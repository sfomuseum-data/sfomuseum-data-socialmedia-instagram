        "body": "At the turn of the twentieth century, women’s ankles were covered with long skirts, silk stockings, and tight-fitting, feminine ankle boots. The majority of shoes were black, brown, or white. Part of the reason for the predominance of black and brown shoes was because people believed that darker colors made feet look smaller. Generally, leather was preferred for most footwear in the late 1890s and early 1900s. As the century progressed and women’s skirts became shorter, they began to wear showier shoes. Buttons and laces were commonly used as closures on shoes and boots in the early 1900s. The wide, curved Louis heel, which originated in the 1700s, re-emerged in the 1870s and remained the common dress-shoe heel until the mid-1920s.
