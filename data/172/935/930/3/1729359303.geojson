        "body": "Entrepreneur Elbert Green Hubbard (1856–1915), founded Roycroft in East Aurora near Buffalo, New York, in 1894. The Roycroft community produced some of the finest furniture, books, lamps, and metalwork of the Arts and Crafts movement. At its peak around 1915, nearly five hundred people worked at Roycroft. A number of talented artisans worked at Roycroft, particularly Dard Hunter (1883–1966), whose designs helped shape the distinctive look of Roycroft’s decorative arts. Metalworker and former banker Karl Kipp (1882–1954), head of the copper shop, also had a long-lasting influence on Roycroft’s metalwork.  Bookends courtesy of Kris Steensma.
