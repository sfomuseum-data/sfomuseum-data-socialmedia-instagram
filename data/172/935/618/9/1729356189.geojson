        "body": "The Urban School is an independent high school in San Francisco whose mission is to ignite a passion for learning and to inspire students to become self-motivated, enthusiastic participants in their education, both in high school and beyond.  During the 2018/2019 academic year, student photographers at the Urban School completed a long-term project where they engaged with and reflected upon the contemporary landscape through their perspective as young adults living in the Bay Area. At the beginning of the project, students visited This Land, an exhibition at Pier 24 Photography, an institution in San Francisco that houses the permanent collection of the Pilara Foundation and is dedicated to collecting, preserving, and exhibiting photography. Using This Land as inspiration, students studied the artists exhibited at Pier 24 Photography during the course of the semester while developing their own projects and visual interpretation of “this land.”",
