The company advertised a range of electroplated silver that had “all the advantages of silver in durability and beauty at one-fifth the cost.” One of the many offerings by Meriden, this fanciful card receiver features a fairy driving a chariot that is being pulled by a robin and includes a glass vase for an additional floral decoration.
