        "body": "In May of 1967, Elaine Mayes was a young freelance photographer living in San Francisco when Hullabaloo magazine assigned her to document a three-day concert scheduled for June 16th through June 18th at the Monterey County Fairgrounds, one hundred miles south of the city. The Monterey International Pop Music Festival was organized to showcase rock music and soul music as art forms. Mayes managed to photograph nearly every performer, many of whom would profoundly affect the course of rock music and popular culture. Mayes’ photographs offer a remarkable level of intimacy with performers at this seminal event, remembered by Mayes as “among the best experiences of my life.” See \"It Happened in Monterey\" photographs by Elaine Mayes, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ElaineMayes",
