        "body": "This two-tone uniform in checked and solid navy blue polyester was created in 1974 by American fashion designer Bill Blass (1922â€“2002), who was known for elegant daywear and traditional fabrics. Giving the appearance of a two-piece outfit with an overskirt top, it is an easy-fit, one-piece shirtdress with a back zipper. The matching skinny belt completes the classic look. \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
