        "body": "In her “Psychscapes”, Terri Loewenthal draws upon the history of California landscape photography, reimagining the genre in a psychedelic light. She captures each image as a single exposure using her unique in-camera process. Her technique shifts colors into oversaturated hues of purples, blues and yellows and overlaps multiple vantage points, offering the viewer a revelatory experience of the Eastern Sierra landscape. By creating images that are “familiar but otherworldly,” Loewenthal presents a vision of the natural world that extends beyond its economic and recreational value, illuminating possibilities of spiritual connection and transcendence. “Psychscape 73 (Downs, Mount, CA)” and “Psychscape 18 (Banner Ridge, CA)” are on display in the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
