In 2013, we presented, “From Ship to Shore: Nautical Arts from the San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park” featuring nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sea-inspired artifacts. Masthead ornaments, scrimshaw, fancy ropework, ships-in-bottles, shadowbox half models, a hand-painted sea chest, and a whalebone chair were all borrowed from the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park (@sfmaritimenps), part of the National Parks Service.
