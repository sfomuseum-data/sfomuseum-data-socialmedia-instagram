        "body": "Have you ever been to a drive-in movie theatre? Drive-in theatres became a favorite entertainment destination during the golden age of the automobile. A boom in the construction of drive-in theatres coincided with the expansion of postwar, suburban housing developments. In 1946, there were 102 drive-in theatres operating in the United States; by 1954, that number had grown to more than 3,000. Drive-ins were quicker and more cost effective to construct than a theatre building, and many operators repurposed surplus projection equipment from 1930s movie houses. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
