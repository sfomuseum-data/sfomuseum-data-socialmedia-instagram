        "body": "Artist Gar Waterman brings magnificence to life with this wasp sculpture. Its long legs and steel construction illustrates the insect’s agility and strength. However, insects could never grow to the size of this sculpture. They would suffocate for lack of oxygen and probably collapse under the weight of their own exoskeletons, which would have to be much thicker and heavier to maintain their shape. [From humble ants to dragonflies and zebra swallowtails, insects have captured the imagination of artists and poets alike.  See “The Intriguing World of Insects” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/IntriguingInsects",
