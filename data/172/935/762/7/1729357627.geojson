        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1968, the first 747 rolled out of Boeing's Everett plant. After the success of the Boeing 707, Pan American World Airways' president, Juan Trippe, decided to order from Boeing a new, much larger long-range jet airliner. Though Trippe retired nearly two years before Pan American introduced the 747, the widebody jumbo jet became a huge success and one of the most recognizable aircraft in the world. To build the 747, the largest commercial airliner at the time, Boeing had to construct a new assembly plant. The purpose-built plant in Everett, Washington, is the largest building in the world by volume, at 200 million-cubic-feet of space over almost 100 acres of land. Completed in 1968, a group of Boeing employees nicknamed \"The Incredibles\" built the first 747-100 at the same time that the building was also being constructed. Have you ever been to the Boeing assembly building in Everett, Washington?  Image:  Pan American World Airways, Boeing 747, late 1960s. Gift of the Captain John B. Russell Family. 2012.149.0877",
