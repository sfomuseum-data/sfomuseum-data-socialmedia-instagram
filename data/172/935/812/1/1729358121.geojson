        "body": "The world’s first twin-engine wide body aircraft, the Airbus A300, was introduced on May 30, 1974. The fuselage of the A300 was wide enough to seat eight across in economy, which was arranged in a two-four-two configuration with two aisles. The first-class cabin seated six across, also with two aisles, in a two-two-two arrangement. The A300 could carry as many as 266 passengers in this two-class configuration, which was a similar capacity to the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L1011 TriStar widebody airliners, but with two engines instead of three, the A300 used approximately thirty percent less fuel. This amounted to a substantial reduction in operating costs for the airlines flying the aircraft and was one of the major reason for the aircraft’s success. After producing over 500 aircraft, Airbus ceased production of the A300 in 2007. Did you ever fly on an Airbus A300?  Image: Singapore Airlines poster, Airbus A300, c. 1981.
