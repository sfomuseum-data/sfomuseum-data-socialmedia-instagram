In 1935, Pan Am inaugurated the world’s first transoceanic service in fixed-wing aircraft with service to Asia from its base at Alameda on San Francisco Bay. The airline’s fleet of flying boats, such as the famous China Clipper, put the San Francisco Bay Area at the leading edge of long-range commercial aviation.
