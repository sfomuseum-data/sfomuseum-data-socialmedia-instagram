        "body": "During the 1800s, many designers were drawn to Classical, Gothic, Egyptian, and Renaissance art and architecture. As with Egypt, archaeological treasures from the ancient Greek and Roman worlds were acquired by museums for public display, and styles were commonly disseminated through periodicals written for architects, furniture makers, and the general public. As a result, Egyptian elements were commonly combined with other revival styles popular at the time. The pedestals shown here are an excellent example of how styles and materials were often eclectically intermixed. They exhibit gilt decoration against ebonized wood and display both Egyptian and Renaissance Revival motifs, pairing together sphinx and lion heads. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
