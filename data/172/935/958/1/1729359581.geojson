        "body": "The Arts and Crafts movement emerged in England in the 1880s. In response to the Industrial Revolution and mass-produced, machine-made objects, the movement emphasized a return to hand craftsmanship. Arts and Crafts advocates rejected the ornate designs and compositions of Victorian-era interiors. Instead, they encouraged quality materials and construction with simple forms and motifs derived from nature.  Arts and Crafts reached its apex from the 1890s to the outbreak of World War I, though the style continued to appear into the 1920s and ’30s. This exhibition features a rich assortment of Arts and Crafts furnishings, from Gustav Stickley textiles to Dirk van Erp copper, and art pottery by makers such as Rookwood and Paul Revere Pottery. “At Home with Arts and Crafts” opens tomorrow, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/SFOArtsandCrafts",
