        "body": "Most women at the height of the Arts and Crafts movement had some knowledge of how to embroider. Favorite motifs on embroidered textiles included butterflies and dragonflies, as well as stylized flowers—from poppies to nasturtiums, irises, and marigolds. Bags of all kinds were embroidered—from pocketbooks to shirt bags and pouches that held slippers or collars and cuffs. Improvements in printing technologies allowed for a proliferation of women’s publications and catalogs. Embroidery floss companies published many of these periodicals, which they filled with embroidery patterns for all manner of items. Patterns were typically bound into magazines so the reader could simply remove them for use in embroidering a purse, throw pillow, or any number of household items.
