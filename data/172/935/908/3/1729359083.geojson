        "body": "The Case Study House program was established by Arts \u0026 Architecture magazine in 1945 in an effort to produce model homes for efficient and affordable living during the housing boom generated after the end of World War II. The artist responsible for documenting these homes was Julius Shulman. Shulman began a career in architectural photography in 1936 when asked by an acquaintance working for Richard Neutra to photograph the architect’s recently completed Kun Residence. His visual interpretation of space struck a chord with Neutra, who hired him to document each of his projects. During the program’s active years, Shulman worked on assignment for the magazine and in collaboration with contributing architects to photograph the majority of the prototype homes. Vivid and persuasive, his photographs capture the essence of each home, rendering the steel and glass structures as inviting and attractive places for modern living.  All photos © J. Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (204. R10). See \"Case Study\" by Julius Shulman on display pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2guQGWH",
