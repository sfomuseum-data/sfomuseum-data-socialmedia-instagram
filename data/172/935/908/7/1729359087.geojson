        "body": "Do you recognize this sculpture? \"Peace\" by Beniamino Bufano was located at SFO between 1958 and 1996. The stainless steel sculpture is a conically shaped Madonna with a glass tile mosaic inlay depicting the Universal Child. It was created for the 1939-40 San Francisco Golden Gate International Exposition but never installed. The sculpture was relocated to its present site on Brotherhood Way in southwest San Francisco when the International Terminal was built. Do you remember seeing this sculpture at SFO?
