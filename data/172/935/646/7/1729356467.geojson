In 1949, the Seeburg Corporation revolutionized the jukebox industry with their model M100A. This 100-selection jukebox featured a “Select-O-Matic” mechanism that played both sides of up to fifty 78-rpm records that were stored in an efficient, vertical file—as opposed to previous jukeboxes that played an average of twenty-four records stacked vertically. Two years later, Seeburg debuted the M100B, a similar jukebox modified for 45-rpm singles. The smaller, 45-rpm record format allowed for even greater jukebox capacities, and in 1958 Seeburg introduced the Model 161, a 160-selection machine that was also available in a 200-song configuration. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
