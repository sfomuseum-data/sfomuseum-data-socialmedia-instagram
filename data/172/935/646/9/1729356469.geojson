        "body": "Exposure to Ancient Egypt inspired the Egyptian Revival, a design style that permeated western decorative arts and furniture in the nineteenth century. Obelisks, hieroglyphs, sphinxes, pyramids, scarabs, and lotus blossoms were popular motifs. Imagery was construed and adapted in different ways, from literal interpretations to fanciful artistic motifs. In furniture, Egyptian Revival pieces rarely comprised a full suite; rather they served as statement pieces. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
