        "body": "For centuries, people have traveled the seas exploring new territories, engaging in trade, fishing, and whaling. Mariners spent long periods of time confined to a ship surrounded by the sea. In the days of sailing ships, a stint aboard might last weeks, months, or years. A seaman had to be a jack-of-all-trades in order to perform his duties. To pass the time during slow periods and calm seas, sailors adapted their varied skill sets to a number of handicrafts. Using their imagination, men transformed wood, bone, and rope into a variety of folk art.
