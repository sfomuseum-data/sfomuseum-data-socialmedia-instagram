        "body": "Happy Birthday to aviatrix Amy Johnson! In 1930, the British aviator Amy Johnson flew the Gipsy Moth G-AAAH solo from England to Australia. She was the first woman to accomplish this feat, and as a result, received the Harmon Trophy and was made Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.  The de Havilland DH-60 Moth was a two-seat biplane of mostly wood construction, with a plywood covered fuselage and cloth covered wings. The Moth readily provided a small, moderately-priced, sturdy, easy to fly aircraft to the public. The DH-60G Gipsy Moth variant was upgraded with the de Havilland Gipsy engine.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
