Featuring an incredible diversity among footwear from around the world, \"Stepping Out\" showcases shoes from various different cultures. For centuries, elevated shoes with platforms, stilts, or heels served to keep one’s feet and clothing protected from dirt, water, and other unfavorable conditions. This exhibition features shoes from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from a variety of countries and cultures. Western wedding shoes, early basketball sneakers, beaded moccasins, European clogs, Chinese children’s shoes, and Japanese geta are a few of the many types on display.  Learn more about shoes from all over the world in \"Stepping Out: Shoes in World Culture\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ShoesinCulture",
