        "body": "2017 marks the end of an era for United Airlines: it will cease to fly the iconic Boeing 747 on commercial routes. United first rolled out the “jumbo jet” in 1970 for the popular west coast-Hawaii route. Compared with the DC-8, the 747 was thirty-five feet longer, ten feet wider inside the cabin, and could carry almost 200 more passengers. Over the next decades, United flew many versions of the 747 on the transcontinental routes and, later, on transoceanic international routes as well. After 2017, these routes will be flown by United’s 777 and 787 wide-body twin jets.
