        "body": "#Onthisday in 1947, Howard Hughes, decided to take the huge Hughes H-4 Hercules (nicknamed the Spruce Goose) on a test flight to prove it could fly. The Hughes H-4 Hercules was one of the largest planes ever constructed, intended as a wartime aircraft to move troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean. On November 2, 1947, off the coast of San Pedro, California, the Hughes H-4 Hercules took off and covered only a mile, at an altitude of 70 feet. The only one of its kind ever built and only flown one time, the prototype now resides on display in the Evergreen Aviation Museum (@evergreenmuseum) in Oregon.  Image: Spruce Goose, 1947.
