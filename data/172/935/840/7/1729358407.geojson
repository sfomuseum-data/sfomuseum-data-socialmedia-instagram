        "body": "In his ongoing series, \"Emergent Behavior\", artist Thomas Jackson creates suspended installations inspired by self-organizing, \"emergent\" systems found in nature such as schooling fish, swarming locusts, or flocking birds. Tapping into the fascination and uncanny feeling that these phenomena often evoke, Jackson's hovering constructions utilize manufactured and mass-produced material - a stark contrast against the picturesque landscapes they inhabit. Working with a 4x5 film camera, Jackson creates large-scale photographs that meditate upon the complex relationship between the natural and the man-made, while inviting a fresh interpretation of everyday objects.  See \"Emergent Behavior\" by Thomas Jackson pre-security in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2phdZEt",
