        "body": "In the 1930s and 1940s, flights from San Francisco to Hong Kong required multiple stops along the way. \"China Clipper\", our exhibition detailing the arduous journey, is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. In 1937, a trip from San Francisco (which actually departed from Alameda) to Hong Kong took at least a week with stops in Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, and Manila. The flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong cost $1,710 round trip, which has the same buying power as about $29,700 in today's money. Have you ever been to Hong Kong?
