        "body": "In a 1939 Miami News article, composer Rudolf Friml (1879–1972) claimed that he used the Ouija board for inspiration. Friml said he first saw a Ouija board in the home of his sister in Czechoslovakia. Through the board, he spoke to several deceased composers including Fryderyk Chopin (1810–1849) and Victor Herbert (1859–1924). The two occasionally dictated music to him. “I really don't want to take it too seriously,” he said, “but it is decidedly interesting. Why Herbert once gave me five notes and I played it on a piano and everyone said it really was Victor Herbert.” “I have a Polish poet who talks to me in rhymes. It gives me perfect song. His name is Roxl and he says he died 51 years ago.” Friml also claimed to have spoken to Woodrow Wilson and Napoleon Bonaparte who gave him insights on world affairs, including the outcome of World War II. Napoleon, he said, told him in French that Germany would lose the war. \"The Mysterious Talking Board: #OuijaAndBeyond\", is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/OuijaAndBeyond #Ouija #OuijaBoard G O O D B Y E",
