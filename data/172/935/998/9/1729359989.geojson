        "body": "Cuban-born designer #Adolfo Sardiña (b. 1933) established his own New York salon in 1963. His 1980 uniform program for #PanAm’s 6,800 flight attendants has Adolfo’s “romantic look” of simple, elegant design. Fashionable and functional, this polyester tailored suit in the softer shade of Pan Am blue has a classic blazer with subtle cuff trim and was worn with a matching vest and ribbon bow tie. With two styles of optional headwear, the uniform was worn until 1991. See more #PanAm #flightattendant #fashion in \"#FashionInFlight\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library and the Main Hall of the International Terminal. The Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm, excluding holidays. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
