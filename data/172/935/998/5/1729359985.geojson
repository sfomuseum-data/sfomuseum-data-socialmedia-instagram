        "body": "Praised by his peers, Spanish designer Cristóbal #Balenciaga (1895–1972) was a master of the sartorial arts—personally designing, cutting, and sewing his creations. He opened an Air France department within his Paris fashion house for the creation of this uniform. This winter suit, in navy blue woolen serge, perfects the semi-fitted look as it liberates the form and retains a lithe appearance. Overlaid flap pockets and a riding hat in satin velour create la mode aéronautique. The knee-length, shaped skirt has kangaroo pockets, and the turned down collar of the Terylene twill blouse adds to the outfit’s liberating comfort. After finishing the Air France collection, Balenciaga closed his fashion house.
