In 2001, we presented “Eames Connection” celebrating the creations of the husband-and-wife team of Charles (1907–78) and Ray (1912–88) Eames. Their philosophy was practical and personal, characterized by a drive to bring good design and artfully modern products to the general public. For over forty years, the Eames Office created items that were beautiful, useful, and meant to provide \"the most of the best to the greatest number of people for the least.\" Do you remember this exhibition?",
