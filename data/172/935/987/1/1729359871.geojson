Rome was the world’s largest city from circa 100 BCE to 400 CE, and the cultural and political center of an empire lasting for more than a millennium. Arguably, Rome resonates most potently in its enduring architectural forms and public monuments, which were first widely disseminated in a very familiar method—through tourism. \"All Roads Lead to Rome: 17th–19th Century Architectural Souvenirs from the Collection of Piraneseum\" displays a collection of souvenirs from the \"Grand Tour\", a trip that all “young lords” took to better understand their world and prepare for their role in it.",
