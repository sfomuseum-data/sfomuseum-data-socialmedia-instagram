Roomy reclining chairs offer generous space for more than 100 passengers in a cabin lounge, wider, more elegant than any previously known in air transportation.  The Boeing 707 Jet is the most thoroughly proven plane ever to enter airline service. The prototype 707, designed specifically as air transport, first flew in 1954, was in continuous operation for over four years before 707's went into airline service. This rigorous test program, over a million air miles, demonstrated the superiority and mechanical perfection of this great jetliner under every conceivable condition.  Thanks to the 707 Jet Flagship, once-distant cities are fast becoming neighbors. And as the world grows smaller, your world grows larger. Places that once were too far away to visit are now just hours from your home. You can board a 707 Jet Flagship in Los Angeles, for example, and be in New York less than five hours later.\" #AmericanAirlines #vintageadvertisement #avgeek #aviationhistory #vintage #boeing #707 #1960s  American Airlines flight information packet 1960 SFO Museum Collection Gift of Thomas G.
