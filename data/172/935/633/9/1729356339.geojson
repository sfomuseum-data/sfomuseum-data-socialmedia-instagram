        "body": "During the late 1930s, appliances for the office and home underwent a major transformation. Typewriters, once boxy with sharp edges and protruding parts, metamorphosed into machines with smooth, flowing appearances. The Remington Rand Streamliner was designed by John Adam Zellers (1873–1954) and Herbert E. Bridgewater (1878–1970) with an external rounded housing reminiscent of a streamlined plane or train, as its name suggests. \"Streamlines: Air Age Aesthetics for Industrial Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Streamlines",
