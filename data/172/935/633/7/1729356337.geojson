        "body": "The first flight of the Boeing 377 took place #onthisday in 1947. The 377, named the #Stratocruiser, was Boeing's first commercial post-war airliner. Pan American World Airwaysâ€™ first aircraft was delivered on January 31, 1949. With passenger accommodations for up to 100, depending on the seating configuration, the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser was a fast, pressurized, large capacity airliner. Following its introduction in 1949, brochures and advertisements promoted its exceedingly smooth ride, its large, roomy, upper deck, and, in particular, the Stratocruiser's unique and luxurious lower-deck lounge. Often regarded as \"the queen of the skies,\" the Stratocruiser became a favorite with passengers due in great part to its lounge.
