        "body": "Greenleaf TK-8 is a Title 1 Oakland public school grounded in diverse community relationships. Art allows Greenleaf students a means to communicate through creative expression. The use of color, form, light, medium, and their own imagination expands their knowledge of the diversity of creative methods to communicate ideas. Honing their skills in visual art and engaging in collaborative projects, such as this poster project which focuses on themes of social justice and environmental awareness, Greenleaf students build their artistic vocabulary and visual literacy. The pieces on view in this exhibition were made by students in the eighth grade and represent the breadth and diversity of artistic vision, expression, and technique of the larger Greenleaf community. “Social Justice Posters” by the students of Greenleaf TK-8 is on display pre-security in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2E2YCYc",
