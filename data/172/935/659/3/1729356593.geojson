        "body": "Do you know that butterflies are a type of moth? They evolved from moth ancestors around 70 million years ago. One way to tell butterflies and moths apart is by the antennae. Butterflies have an inflated segment at the end of their thread-like antennae. Moths have a great diversity of antennae—hairy, feathery, thick, or thread-like, but no inflated segment at the end. Like all insects, the antennae are lined with chemical sensors to help them find food and mates.  See “The Intriguing World of Insects” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal.  http://bit.ly/IntriguingInsects",
