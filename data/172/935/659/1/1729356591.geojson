These seats featured either upholstery crafted into the seat and either slip-on or strap-on cushions. The aluminum seat shown here was designed in the 1940s by the Warren McArthur Corporation specifically for the Douglas DC-3 and C-47, the military transport version of the DC-3. It was the first seat designed by the company for passenger use in an airplane and adjustable to five positions. \"Aluminum: The Miracle Metal of Aviation\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AviationAluminum  Image: Douglas DC-3 airplane seat, c. 1943.
