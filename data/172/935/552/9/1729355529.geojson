        "body": "This is your last week to see “California Studio Craft: featuring works from the Forrest L. Merrill collection.” Studio craft combines the characteristics of traditional, handmade craft with the refined qualities of fine art. Made by professional artist-craftspeople who work in a variety of media, studio craft includes both utilitarian items and more experimental pieces that focus on aesthetics over function. For many, studio craft is an imaginative and personal expression that encourages creativity through the exploration of time-tested materials and techniques. The finest objects evoke emotion and exhibit the process of making along with evidence of the artist’s hand.  See \"California Studio Craft: Featuring Works from the Forrest L. Merrill Collection\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/CaliforniaCrafts",
