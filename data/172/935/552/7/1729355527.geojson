        "body": "Stanley Henry Page (1885-1964) was an early twentieth-century San Francisco Bay Area engineer who, like many young men of his generation, was inspired by the new technologies of flight. Page had a small flying boat designed around one of his own aero engines and flew extensively around the Bay Area, photographing points of interest. Do you recognize either of these locations?  See “Above the Bay: The Aerial Photography of Stanley Page” on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. . . .",
