In the late 1930s, airlines began to recognize that they also presented an excellent opportunity for branding and advertising as an inflight giveaway. Carriers distributed uniquely designed decks with the airline’s logo, and the latest service promotions, often for destinations served or the carrier’s latest airliner. Do you have a favorite card game?  A special thank you to Thomas G. Dragges, who donated all of these decks of playing cards. ",
