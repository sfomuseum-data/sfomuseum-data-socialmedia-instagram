        "body": "\"In recent months, I have been moving closer to traditional silversmithing, but I'm still keen to combine this with advanced technology…to bridge the gap between the two different approaches so that they become integrated, with the finished work having a natural feel without any hint of fabrication.\" Hamish Dobbie (b. 1991). Glasgow-based silversmith Hamish Dobbie gains much of his inspiration from the rugged landscape of Western Scotland. With geological features such as the hexagonal formations on the island of Staffa in mind, Dobbie uses advanced techniques that include 3D printing and CAD (Computer Aided Design) software to combine modern aesthetics and traditional silversmithing. Dobbie’s Two Brothers’ bowl comprises a pair of nesting bowls made by the artist in 2014 while in residency at the Glasgow School of Art. The highly polished surface of the spun, inner-bowl reflects an outer mesh basket made from hundreds of joined, silver shapes cast from 3D-printed components. Dobbie was the first recipient of the P \u0026 O Makower Trust Award, granted in 2015 to commission a silver vase for the National Museums of Scotland.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver . . .",
