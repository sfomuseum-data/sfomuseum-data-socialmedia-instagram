        "body": "In his series, \"Standard Stars\", Eric William Carroll examines and engages with an archive of decaying astronomical glass plate negatives held by the Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute in Rosman, North Carolina. The instituteâ€™s Astronomical Photographic Data Archive (APDA) contains one of the largest collections of astronomical glass plates and represents nearly 150 years of efforts to study, catalog, and define the cosmos. Working directly with the photographic plates, Carroll composes new images from the emulsion that has peeled and separated from the glass backing over time. In revisiting the APDA and drawing focus on the deteriorating plates, Standard Stars recontextualizes the fragile objects to ask larger questions about the history of photography and the nature of obsolescence. \"Standard Stars\" by Eric William Carroll is on display pre-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2CMrEez",
