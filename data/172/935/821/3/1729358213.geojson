        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1953, the Douglas DC-7 took its maiden flight. American Airlines initially ordered 25 of the aircraft to compete with TWAâ€™s Super Constellations. The DC-7 could travel nonstop from coast to coast with a cruising speed of 360 mph and carried 58 to 95 passengers. The Douglas DC-7C, the ultra-long range, final evolution of the design, was capable of crossing the North Atlantic nonstop. In total 338 of the aircraft, including all variations, were built. Have you ever flown on a DC-7?  Image:  Douglas DC-7, c. 1953. Gift of Rochelle (Webb) Malatesta, Barbara (Webb) Pearson and Charlotte (Webb) Farr in memory of our parents, U. S.
