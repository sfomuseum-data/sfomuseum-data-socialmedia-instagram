The photographs of San Francisco’s skies are intermingled with iconic San Francisco landmarks, and infused with Persian motifs to make complex portraits of the city’s sky-scape. Mazinani states, \"I was always really interested in borders and issues around land and landlessness, and being an immigrant, and I found it really rewarding to look up at the sky and see these beautiful clouds moving — without any limitations, without checkpoints, without passports.\" \"Forever in the Sky\" by Sanaz Mazinani, is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2lkuhvZ",
