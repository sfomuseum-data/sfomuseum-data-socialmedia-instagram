        "body": "Rebecca de Quin is drawn to the vast, artistic potential offered by working with silver. As a silversmith and teacher, she is “captivated by the purity and simplicity of silver sheet” and has found inspiration in the two-dimensional works of the cubist painter Amédée Ozenfant (1886–1966), the modernist architect and artist Le Corbusier (1887–1965), and her father, the constructivist sculptor Robert de Quin (1927–2002). In her work, de Quin wishes to “challenge perceptions of three-dimensional form.” Her innovative silversmithing techniques that combine cutting, scoring, and folding, are demonstrated in her centerpiece, pictured here, which provides remarkably different impressions from every perspective.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
