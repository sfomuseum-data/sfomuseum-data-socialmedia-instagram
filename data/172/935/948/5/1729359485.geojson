        "body": "The Sholes \u0026 Glidden Type Writer ushered in a new era of communication technology. Invented by Christopher Latham Sholes (1819–90) with assistance from Samuel Soulé (1830–75) and Carlos Glidden (1834–77) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it was the first commercially produced typewriter with hinged type-bars and a four-row keyboard. In 1873, the Type Writer introduced “QWERTY,” a keyboard layout named for the first six letters at the top-left row of letter keys. Organized to prevent type-bars from clashing and jamming prototype machines, QWERTY was mechanically suited to the Sholes \u0026 Glidden and not necessarily designed for efficient typing. Contemporary computers, tablets, and smart phones share the QWERTY keyboard layout.
