        "body": "In Hong Kong, buildings are wrapped in colorful nylon mesh to protect the streets below from the dust and debris generated by construction. While this construction technique serves as a practical safety measure, it also produces an aesthetically appealing result: under a cloak of scrim, buildings that will soon fit neatly into their ubiquitous surroundings transform into shockingly visible, candy-colored monoliths. Choosing to work only on cloudy days, the artist uses the soft light of an overcast sky to intensify the various hues of the colorful structures. In his series \"Cocoons\", photographer #PeterSteinhauer catalogs these monochromatic sites of transformation.  See \"Cocoons\" by #PeterSteinhauer, post-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2p5nEAq",
