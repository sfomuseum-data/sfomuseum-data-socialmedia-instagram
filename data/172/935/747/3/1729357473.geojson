This 151-foot copper statue of a Roman liberty goddess, Libertas, became a symbol of freedom and hope to newly arriving immigrants. The statue faces southeast and was strategically placed for passing ships to see her as a welcoming sight. She is celebrated in innumerable ways: she's on our currency (the Presidential $1 coins) and in countless souvenirs, tourist photos, and, in this case, a Pan Am destination poster. Have you ever been to the Statue of Liberty?  Image: Pan American World Airways poster, New York, 1980s. Gift of Neva Harper. 2010.243.004",
