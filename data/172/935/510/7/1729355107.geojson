This Ibibio crest mask depicts a female beauty with elaborate coils of spiraling, braided hair. The hairstyle depicted on this crest mask, depicts an exaggerated version of one worn in real life. African sculptors often refrain from copying exactly what they see, instead using the natural world as a source of inspiration.
