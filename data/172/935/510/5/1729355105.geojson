        "body": "#Onthisday in 1954, the three-day dedication ceremony for San Francisco International Airport’s new terminal building kicked off. As SFO had reached 2 million passengers by 1952, this new facility was designed to accommodate several million additional passengers. The upper level was for departures and the lower level was for arrivals, each with its own roadway. A spacious restaurant named the International Room provided panoramic views of the airfield. Later called the Central Terminal, the building has been modified several times over the years and is now called Terminal 2. What is your favorite SFO memory?
