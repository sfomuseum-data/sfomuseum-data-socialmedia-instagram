        "body": "This is your last week to see \"At Home with Arts and Crafts!” The Arts and Crafts movement emerged in England in the 1880s. In response to the Industrial Revolution and mass-produced, machine-made objects, the movement emphasized a return to hand craftsmanship. Inspired by the writings of John Ruskin (1819–1900), who exalted the medieval craft guild system, artist and designer William Morris (1834–96) served as the movement’s spearhead. Arts and Crafts advocates rejected the ornate designs and compositions of Victorian-era interiors. Instead, they encouraged quality materials and construction with simple forms and motifs derived from nature.
