        "body": "In the early 1970s, United Airlines commissioned aviation artist Nixon Galloway of Manhattan Beach, California, to create a series of watercolor paintings depicting each aircraft flown by the airline and its subsidiaries from the beginning of the company’s history. Over the next ten years, the artist created forty-three paintings of individual aircraft. All of the paintings were reproduced as lithograph prints on 8 ½” x 11” wove paper to create the promotional “United Airlines Collector Series” as premium giveaways for passenger loyalty programs. Single prints were sent, usually on a bi-monthly basis, to United’s frequent flyers, such as members of the Million Mile Club and the Executive Air Travel Program, one of the first airline mileage rewards programs. The mailings included cards with historical and performance information about the subject aircraft, and many of the prints were re-issued over the years as multiple editions.  See Nixon Galloway's stunning aircraft illustrations in \"Flying the Main Line: A History of United Airlines\", located post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/TheMainLine",
