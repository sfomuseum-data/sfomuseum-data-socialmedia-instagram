During the Meiji (1868-1912) and early Taisho (1912-26) periods, another type of shop sign developed. Rather than represent what the merchant sold inside, these shop signs display auspicious characters and symbols, such as beckoning cats, to lure customers.  This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum. \"Maneki Neko: Japanese Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2.  http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
