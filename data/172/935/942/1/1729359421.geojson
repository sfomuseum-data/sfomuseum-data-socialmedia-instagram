        "body": "This is your last week to catch \"#GamesofChance\" in Terminal 3. A gambler transported from a turn-of-the-twentieth-century saloon in San Francisco’s Barbary Coast would easily recognize a modern slot machine in today’s casinos. Even with new materials and modern technology, the play concept has changed remarkably little in the more than one hundred years since San Francisco inventor Charles Fey introduced the first automatic-payout, three-reel slot machine—payment is inserted, the handle is pulled or the button is pressed, and the reels, now simulated, spin to a stop to determine the outcome.  All objects are courtesy of Joe Welch American Antique Museum in San Bruno, California. See \"#GamesofChance: Gambling Devices of the Mechanical Age\" and our accompanying photography show, \"The American Saloon: Historical Photographs from the Collection of Roger E. Kislingbury\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/GamesofChance ",
