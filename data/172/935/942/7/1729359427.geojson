        "body": "Human vision allows for the perception of only a minute portion of the electromagnetic spectrum—we see this as visible light in a range of color, from violet on one end of the visible spectrum to red on the other. Los Angeles-based artist and photographer Lisa Gizara uses black and white infrared film and modified digital cameras to make photographs that reveal light from the infrared spectrum. She now uses these tools to produce landscape photographs that transform the ordinary into something strange and arresting, revealing a mysterious world hidden only by our inability to perceive it.  See \"Beyond the Spectrum\" by photographer Gizara, pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2rx6ucB",
