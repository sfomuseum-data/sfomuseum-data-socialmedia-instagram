The plane, often referred to as the first modern airliner, had its first flight on February 8, 1933. This streamlined, twin-engine airliner featured all-metal construction, retractable landing gear, and seating for ten passengers. With a cruising speed of 188 mph, the 247 was faster than the U.S. Army’s most modern fighter at the time.  Image: United Air Lines postcard, Boeing 247, 1930s. Gift of Thomas G.
