The Chitpore Road in Calcutta led north through the Bara or Great Bazaar and was the main thoroughfare and market for the Bengali community in the city.  This typical Calcutta scene shows the residence of a wealthy merchant complete with a verandah overlooking the street and an open rooftop pavilion, which no longer exists. Cottages with Bengali style thatched roofs surround it. The nearby temple above the houses in the distance still remains.  All objects and images are from the collection of Michael Sack. \"From #PrintToPlate: Views of the East on #Transferware\" is on display, every day, 24 hours a day, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/PrintToPlate",
