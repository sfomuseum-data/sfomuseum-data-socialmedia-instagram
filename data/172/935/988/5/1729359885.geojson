        "body": "Aluminum made twentieth-century modern marvels such as airline travel, refrigeration, and space flight a reality. Early uses of aluminum included power transmission lines, overhead electrical wiring for streetcars, and internal combustion engines such as the Wright brothers’ four-cylinder 1903 Flyer engine.  Industrial designers promoted aluminum’s strength, light weight, conductivity, and luster in an astounding array of products, from metallic paint and textiles, to TV dinner trays, washing machines, food packaging, and Greyhound busses. Modern designers employed aluminum extensively in mid-century architecture, while sleek, space-age aluminum items reflected progress through technology in products for the home.",
