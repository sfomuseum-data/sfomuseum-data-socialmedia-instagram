        "body": "Dung beetles, June bugs, chafers, and scarabs all belong to the beetle family Scarabaeidae. They all have lamellate antennae, which means the ends of their antennae can spread like fingers. Goliath beetles are the largest insects on Earth in terms of body mass. Some species, such as rose beetles and chafers, can be abundant pests in gardens, feeding on roots as larvae and on leaves and flowers as adults. Dung beetles and other detritivores are responsible for recycling nutrients and preventing animal waste from building up and breeding pest flies. In places where cows and other large mammals are not native, dung beetles have been purposely introduced to help control their waste.  See “The Intriguing World of Insects” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/IntriguingInsects",
