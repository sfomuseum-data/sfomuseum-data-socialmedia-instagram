The 707 was developed by Boeing as the result of an initial 1955 request from Pan American for a large jet-powered airliner. The jet’s speed and passenger capacity enabled the airline to substantially reduce their seat-mile costs, thus lowering ticket prices and open up air travel to a larger percentage of the public. As a result of its efficiency, the 707 proved to be the world’s first truly successful commercial jetliner with consistent, sustained scheduled service. Have you ever flown on a Boeing 707?
