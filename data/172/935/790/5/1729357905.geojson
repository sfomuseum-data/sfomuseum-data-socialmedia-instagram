        "body": "Bay Area history: An avid inventor and a professor of electrical engineering, Charles Herrold (1875–1948) conducted the first scheduled radio broadcasts by inventing his own wireless transmitting technology. From 1912 to 1917, Charles and his wife Sybil conducted a series of broadcasts from The Herrold College of Wireless and Engineering in downtown San Jose, California. Regularly scheduled shows included the Little Hams Program, aired every Wednesday evening for students and other wireless radio operators in the Santa Clara Valley. During the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, the Herrolds beamed daily broadcasts to receiving stations constructed at the fairgrounds in San Francisco, fifty miles to the north. For the majority of attendees, this was their first experience with radio, and thousands of listeners marveled at the mysterious “voices from the sky.” \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
