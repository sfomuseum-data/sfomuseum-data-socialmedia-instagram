        "body": "Modern jukeboxes trace their origins to coin-operated phonographs. Marketed as automatic phonographs, these late-nineteenth-century machines combined Thomas Alva Edison’s (1847–1931) wax cylinder phonograph with a coin-operated mechanism. Edison patented the first cylinder phonograph in 1878 after experimenting with a device that recorded audible messages from a telegraph or telephone signal. This machine utilized a metal cylinder wrapped in tinfoil and was more of a novelty, as recordings quickly degraded after a few plays. Edison’s Improved Phonograph followed a decade later with wax cylinders that greatly increased the life-span of recordings. During the 1890s, electrically operated automatic phonographs were produced by various manufacturers under license from Edison. Nicknamed “nickel-in-the-slot” machines, they appeared in arcade parlors across the United States alongside Kinetoscopes, another Edison invention that played short movies from 35 mm film.
