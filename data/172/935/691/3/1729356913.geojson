        "body": "In 1959, United Air Lines and Delta Airlines introduced the Douglas DC-8. The DC-8-63 series followed nearly a decade later. Promoted as the “Super 63”, it was an updated, stretched, long-range variant. With a capacity of up to 244 passengers, it was the largest commercial jetliner available at the time, until the introduction of the Boeing 747. Powered by Pratt \u0026 Whitney JT3D turbofan engines it was capable of cruising at up to 575 miles-per-hour. The turbofans were more efficient, less noisy, and more economical to operate than the earlier jet engines. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines purchased a large fleet of the DC-8-63 and operated them though the 1980s. The airliner was reliable, comfortable, and ideal for the carrier’s transoceanic, world routes.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
