        "body": "By the early 1950s, Southern California shapers were creating thin, rounded boards with side profiles that were curved upward at the nose and tail. These easy-riding Malibu Chip boards were perfectly suited for the smaller surf that is common at places like San Onofre and Malibu. In the 1960s, lightweight and cost-effective polyurethane foam and fiberglass surfboards revolutionized the surfing industry. Hermosa Beach surfer-shaper Dudley “Hap” Jacobs (b. 1930), who partnered with Dale Velzy (1927–2005) in the mid-1950s to make balsa boards, manufactured high-quality surfboards from polyurethane foam. Jacobs’ shaping talent and acute business sense made his business one of the most successful and influential of the booming 1960s longboard era. \"Reflections in Wood — Surfboards and Shapers\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal! http://bit.ly/SurfboardsAndShapers",
