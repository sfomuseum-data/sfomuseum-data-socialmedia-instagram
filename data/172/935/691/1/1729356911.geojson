        "body": "Cats were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society. Used to protect crops and as hunting companions, cats were also essential pest controllers in grain stores and kitchens. Felines were so prized that members of the household often shaved their eyebrows as a sign of mourning when a familyâ€™s cat passed away. The discovery of the tomb of King Tutankhamun in 1922 by Howard Carter sparked a renewed enthusiasm for all things Egyptian. Mirroring their importance to the ancient Egyptians, the cat, such as these, was the subject of many items made in the Egyptian Revival style.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
