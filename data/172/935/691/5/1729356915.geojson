        "body": "#Onthisday in 1965, the Douglas DC-9 took off on its maiden flight. The DC-9 was designed as a mid-range jetliner with a smaller capacity than the Boeing 727 and with the capability of serving the shorter runways of small regional airports. Similar to the Sud Aviation Caravelle, it featured two jet engines mounted at the rear of the fuselage and a high-mounted horizontal stabilizer. In operation, the DC-9 was highly successful for numerous airlines worldwide.  Have you ever flown on a DC-9?  Image: AirCal, Douglas DC-9, San Francisco International Airport (SFO), 1981.
