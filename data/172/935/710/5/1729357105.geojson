        "body": "\"Sydney is just 37 1/2 hours from California!\" In 1951, flying from Los Angeles or San Francisco to Sydney, Australia, was major achievement in commercial aviation technology. It included stopovers in Hawai'i and Fiji. The double-decker Boeing 377 Stratocruiser was introduced in 1949 by Pan American World Airways. The aircraftâ€™s four twenty-eight-cylinder Pratt \u0026 Whitney radial engines enabled the Stratocruiser, as its name asserted, to cruise in the stratosphere at over 300 miles per hour. With a range of just over 4,000 miles, the airliner was ideally suited for transoceanic routes.  Image: Pan American World Airways, Sunset advertisement, 1951. SFO Museum Collection. 2017.112.018",
