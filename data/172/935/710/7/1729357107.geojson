        "body": "Television introduced a series of western-themed shows that delighted children all over America. Dolls, lunchboxes, and other toys accompanied The Howdy Doody Show (1947–60), one of the era’s most successful children’s shows. Created and hosted by “Buffalo Bob” Smith (1917–98), the iconic, marionette theater program provided a blueprint for children’s television programming. Four years later, The Roy Rogers Show (1951–57) premiered on NBC, starring the actor-musician and “King of the Cowboys,” Roy Rogers (1911–98). Set in the fictional town of Mineral City, the show featured Rogers, his golden palomino Trigger, and the theme-song “Happy Trails,” a duet performed alongside Rogers’ wife and co-star, Dale Evans (1912–2001). \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer . . .",
