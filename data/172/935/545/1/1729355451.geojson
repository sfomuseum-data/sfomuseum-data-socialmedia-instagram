In 2013, we presented “The Art of Recology: The Artist in Residence Program 1990-2013,” which featured art from dozens of artists involved in Recology’s Artist in Residence program. This program’s mission is to inspire and educate by providing local artists with access to materials, a work space, and monetary and administrative support. Do you remember this exhibition? http://bit.ly/2Tnq2jQ",
