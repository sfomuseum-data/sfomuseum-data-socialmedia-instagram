Electricity is Life by Midland Manufacturing was one of the best-selling, coin-operated electric shockers. Produced from 1899 to 1909, Electricity is Life was advertised as both a strength tester and electrical therapy device. Widely placed in saloons, this machine promoted competition among saloon clientele while offering the “healthy” benefits of electrical therapy. \"The Automatic Age: Coin-Operated Machines\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/CoinOperated",
