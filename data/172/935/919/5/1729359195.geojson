        "body": "William Howell Bull (1861–1940) moved to California from New York in the late 1800s. In 1893, Bull organized a trip with three other men to explore and sketch the south fork of Kings River. In 1901, Bull became a resident of San Mateo where he lived for the rest of his life and a year later co-founded the California Society of Artists as an alternative to the earlier established San Francisco Art Association. Around 1915, he worked as a commercial artist for the Southern Pacific Railroad, and also provided illustrations to Pacific Electric, Sunset magazine, and Stanford University. Bull’s rare landscape paintings typically feature scenic areas in Northern California.
