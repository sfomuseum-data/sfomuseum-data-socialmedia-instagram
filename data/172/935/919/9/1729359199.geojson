        "body": "In the decade between the late-1930s and late-1940s, United Air Lines introduced a series of modern airliners that elevated air travel to new levels of speed and comfort.  United called its new aircraft Mainliners, including the Douglas DC-3, DC-6, and the later Boeing 377, and used them to establish its position as the leading American air carrier.  The DC-6 and Boeing 377 employed cabin pressurization, pioneered during the late 1930s, to enable the aircraft to fly higher and faster than ever before. The extended range and capacity of these airplanes allowed United to open a new route from California to Hawai’i in 1947.  The new aircraft and America’s postwar prosperity increased the volume of air travel to record levels. The four-engine airliners made non-stop, coast-to-coast flights possible in just under ten hours. Americans continued to travel by air for business, and more and more people were choosing airlines for their vacation travel as well. United began new marketing campaigns specifically promoting vacation destinations, particularly their new route to Hawai’i.  Poster courtesy of the United Airlines Archives.
