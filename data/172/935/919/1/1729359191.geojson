In this exhibition, we see the artist’s work from California and Nevada, where he looks closely at how people interact with the resource in areas that are prone to drought. Abdulaziz strikes a balance between images that depict places where water is stored and used in vast quantities, and images that offer scenes from more intimate, day-to-day interactions with water. Choosing to avoid a didactic approach to the topic, Abdulaziz instead produces skillfully rendered images that encourage a greater awareness of the use, misuse, and collective mindset towards a resource that is vital to sustain and connect humanity on a global scale. \"Water\" by Mustafah Abdulaziz is located post-security in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2vuRMp5",
