        "body": "With sewing skills learned from crafting his own drag costumes, in 1978 Gilbert Baker was asked by City Supervisor and gay rights leader Harvey Milk and other local activists to create a new symbol for the movement. Baker seized on the idea of a flag as an appropriate symbol to proclaim power for his “tribe,” and a rainbow to represent his community’s diversity. He assigned symbolic meaning to each of the flag’s original eight colors—pink for sexuality, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for art, indigo for peace and harmony, and purple for spirit. He continued to craft flags until he passed in 2017.  Photo courtesy of Mick Hicks.
