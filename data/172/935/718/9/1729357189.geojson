A legendary figure in the aviation industry, he was integral to the advancement and promotion of aviation in the twentieth century. Among his many achievements were a record-breaking around-the-world flight in a modified Lockheed Super Electra 14 in 1938, his acquisition and transformation of TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air) into a world-leading international carrier renamed Trans World Airlines (TWA), his vision and leadership role in the development of the Lockheed Constellation airliner, and his acquisition and makeover of the struggling Air West in 1970 to become the highly successful Hughes Airwest.
