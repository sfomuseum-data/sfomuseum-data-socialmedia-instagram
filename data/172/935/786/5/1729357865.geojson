        "body": "Though born in Los Angeles, Isamu Noguchi attended elementary school in Japan. Like any other schoolchild in Japan, he learned origami and kirigami (the folding and cutting of paper). This early training gave him an irresistible compulsion to make three-dimensional sculpture from two-dimensional materials, including these metal sheet sculptures.  Thank you to The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum for their generous loan. See \"Isamu Noguchi: Inside and Out\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/NoguchiSFO",
