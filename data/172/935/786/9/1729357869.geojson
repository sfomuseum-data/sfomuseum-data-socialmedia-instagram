        "body": "\"Voyage\" is a glass panel installation that depicts an imaginary panoramic space in continuous flux. The artwork draws on the language of maps, inspired by information pertaining to San Francisco International Airport, such as (maps, plans, weather patterns and flight routes). The drawn and painted abstractions make physical locations visible while giving the viewer the opportunity to shape their own psychological and emotional connections that constitute place. \"Voyage\" by @valbritton is on display, pre-security, in the departures level of Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/2L9Zqw3",
