        "body": "Ancient Egyptian decoration and ornamentation were frequently derived from the flora and fauna found along the Nile. Egyptians observed the lotus plant rising from the water, opening at daybreak, closing at dusk, and sinking beneath the water. As such, they associated the flower with rebirth and depictions of the lotus commonly appeared in their art. In the Egyption Revival style of the 19th century, the stylized lotus blossom was often applied to furniture and decorative arts.  The ancient Egyptian motif of the winged sun disk, a symbol of the sun god offering protection, was carved over many doors in ancient Egypt. It consisted of a sun disk, a sacred cobra, and on each side, a pair of outspread wings, suggesting the daily passage of the sun in the heavens. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
