        "body": "Lesser known and slightly older than the Golden Gate Bridge, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge has one of the longest spans in the United States and carries over 260,000 cars each day. Designed by Charles H. Purcell, it opened six months before the Golden Gate Bridge, on #onthisday in 1936. After part of the East Span collapsed during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, work began on a seismic retrofit. Ultimately, the East Span was replaced and reopened in 2013. Have you ever traveled across the Bay Bridge?  Image: San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge approach, 1937. SFO Museum Collection. 2013.117.025",
