Designed by Charles H. Purcell, it opened six months before the Golden Gate Bridge, on #onthisday in 1936. After part of the East Span collapsed during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, work began on a seismic retrofit. Ultimately, the East Span was replaced and reopened in 2013. Have you ever traveled across the Bay Bridge?  Image: San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge approach, 1937. SFO Museum Collection. 2013.117.025",
