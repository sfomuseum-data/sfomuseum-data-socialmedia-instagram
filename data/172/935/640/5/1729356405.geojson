His uniform program for Pan American’s 6,800 flight attendants in 1980 has Adolfo’s “romantic look” of simple, elegant design. Fashionable and functional, this polyester tailored suit in the softer shade of Pan Am blue has a classic blazer with subtle cuff trim and was worn with a matching vest and ribbon bow tie. With two styles of optional headwear, the uniform was worn until 1991.  Image: Pan American World Airways, flight attendants, 1980. Gift of the Pan Am Association. 2000.058.0503.002 ",
