        "body": "By the mid-1950s, record companies released the majority of rhythm-and-blues and rock ‘n’ roll songs as 45-rpm singles. To promote record sales, RCA Victor introduced an affordable line of 45-rpm record players. Marketed towards teenagers and young adults, these portable devices allowed for the playback of popular records in bedrooms and away from the living room, out of earshot from prying parents. The extended-play 45, or EP, was released in 1951. EPs featured slanted record grooves as opposed to the vertical grooves in a standard 45, allowing for almost 8 minutes of playing time, or two normal-length pop songs, per side. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
