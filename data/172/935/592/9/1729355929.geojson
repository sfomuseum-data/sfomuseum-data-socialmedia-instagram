        "body": "Bees, wasps, and ants all belong to the order Hymenoptera, meaning membranous wings. Most honey bees, yellowjacket wasps, and ants are social species. These insects live in societies with overlapping generations and complex visual and chemical communication systems. For example, honey bees do a “waggle dance” to communicate the distance, direction, and quality of nectar and pollen resources. Most bees, however, are solitary. They provision each egg with just enough pollen and nectar to grow to adulthood, and then fly away forever. When foraging among flowers, bees accidentally drop pollen, which pollinates the plant. Nearly 4,400 different species of bees inhabit North America, and more than 20,000 species of bees exist worldwide.
