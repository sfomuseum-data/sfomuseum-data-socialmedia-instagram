        "body": "United Air Lines introduced hot meal service on Douglas DST (Douglas Sleeper Transport) and DC-3 flights in the late 1930s. The DC-3 was one of the first airliners to be equipped with a galley. Meals on short, daytime flights were served with paper or plastic cups and plates to reduce weight. Ceramic wares were specifically designed to be light, yet sturdy, for inflight use. Silver-plated flatware was offered with most types of meal service. One set featured the same \"Embossed\" art deco pattern incorporated on the airline's blue plastic dishes.  See \"Flying the Main Line: A History of United Airlines\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/TheMainLine",
