        "body": "Folk pottery is still made today in North Carolina and Georgia. The southern tradition has emphasized high-fired stoneware vessels that could withstand rough usage on the farm. Alkaline stoneware glazes are distinctly regional, with wood ashes or lime mixed in a solution to help melt the other ingredients-usually sand and clay. These glazes turn green or brown depending on the firing conditions and can have a runny texture. They were developed in South Carolina around 1815, perhaps inspired by published accounts of similar high-firing Chinese glazes.  The face jug made by Georgia's Lanier Meaders represents a later-twentieth-century shift in emphasis from utilitarian farm wares to more decorative pieces for collectors, a trend that continues today.  Jugs are courtesy of the Atlanta History Center and courtesy of John Burrison.
