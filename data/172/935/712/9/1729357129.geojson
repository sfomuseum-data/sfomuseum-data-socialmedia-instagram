        "body": "By the 17th century, cats appeared in European artwork that depicted daily life, including street scenes, interior settings, and views of the kitchen. In the Netherlands, many Dutch artists considered the cat as a representation of domesticity and painted felines into genre paintings and portraiture. This view of a man petting a cat was painted by a follower of Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–69), the Dutch master of the dramatic effects on light and shadow known as chiaroscuro. Unlike most works from Rembrandt’s era that feature feline subjects, the artist has placed a cat at center stage. The work was likely commissioned by a proud pet owner and draws the viewer in through the cat’s wide eyes and intense stare.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
