        "body": "The Boeing 727 was a medium range, intermediate-capacity jetliner that could serve regional airports with short runways. It featured a clean swept wing, a high horizontal stabilizer, and a unique tri-jet configuration, which was influenced by the Hawker Siddeley Trident. The only tri-jet to be developed by Boeing, the 727 was equipped with three Pratt \u0026 Whitney JT8D-7 turbofan engines mounted in a triangular configuration at the tail-end of the aircraft—two attached with extended mounts and the middle mounted within the vertical stabilizer. This design dictated that the horizontal stabilizer be placed well away from the middle engine, high on top of the vertical stabilizer. At the aft underbelly was a uniquely located passenger door and air stair that allowed passengers to exit from the back of the aircraft. Braniff International Airways purchased a large fleet of the 727 and, after advertising executive Mary Wells radically revamped the airline’s corporate identity, painted their aircraft in a variety of brightly colored liveries.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
