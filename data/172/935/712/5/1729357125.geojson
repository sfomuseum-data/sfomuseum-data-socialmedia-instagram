        "body": "The Golden Gate Bridge is an internationally recognized symbol of San Francisco. Spanning almost two miles of water between Marin County and San Francisco, it held the title of the longest main span suspension bridge for almost 30 years. This gigantic undertaking started #onthisday in 1933 and finished in 1937. Did you know that the Golden Gate Bridge is not named for its color but for the body of water it crosses, the Golden Gate strait? The bridge is painted in \"International Orange\" color to provide enhanced visibility for passing ships. Have you visited this popular tourist destination?
