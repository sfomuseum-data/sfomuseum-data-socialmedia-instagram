        "body": "In 1969, Continental Airlines received Civil Aeronautics Board approval for a route to Hawai’i. Throughout the 1960s, tourism to the islands had steadily grown, along with the demand for airline flights. Continental launched service to Hawai’i in September 1969 operating Boeing 320Cs. The airline received its first deliveries of the Boeing 747 in the late spring of 1970 and launched service to Honolulu that summer. The service was widely advertised and featured on promotional items such as branded flight bags. Do you own any flight bags? “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV  Image: Continental Airlines Hawaii flight bag, 1970s.
