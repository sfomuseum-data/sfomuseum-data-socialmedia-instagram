        "body": "Dubbed “The Uniform for the Superjet Era,” and created for the new wide-body jet service, this uniform marked a new direction in Pan American’s approach to fashion. It was created by Frank Smith (1927–2007), chief designer at career wear manufacturer Evan-Picone, to be “a functional and fashionable wardrobe that could be worn in all seasons, and of such quality that it would enhance the Pan Am image.” For the first time, the Pan Am stewardess could choose from two colors, Superjet Blue or Galaxy Gold. Fashioned after an English riding habit, it has a modified chesterfield jacket and a flared camisole skirt in polyester with the airline’s first above-the-knee hemline, and a cotton blouse with neckpiece. Topping off the dramatic new look is the bowler derby and reversible cape.  See more Pan American uniforms in \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight1",
