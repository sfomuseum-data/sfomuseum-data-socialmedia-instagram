        "body": "In the early 1960s, United Air Lines brought new jet airliners into service providing unprecedented speed, comfort, and efficiency. With the Douglas DC-8 and the Boeing 720, coast-to-coast travel time was less than six hours. The interiors of the new jets were far more spacious and quiet than any of the propeller-driven airliners. With more interior space, greater attention was paid to inflight amenities such as elaborate, multi-course meal service, inflight movies, and individualized air conditioning controls. Have you ever flown on a DC-8?
