Nicknamed the Boeing Bug, this pin, a reproduction of Boeing Air Transport’s uniform insignia from the early 1930s, was worn by BAT’s first stewardess Ellen Church and the seven other women who join her in 1930. They were the earliest stewardesses to fly in the airline industry. In 1931, Boeing Air Transport was consolidated into United Air Lines",
