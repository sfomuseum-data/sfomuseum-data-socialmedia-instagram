        "body": "Oxchuc is both a city and larger municipality, located to the east of San Andrés in Los Altos de Chiapas. The indigenous Mayan citizens of Oxchuc speak Tzeltal, a close linguistic cousin to the Mayan dialect spoken by their Tzotzil neighbors. Artisans from San Andrés and Oxchuc also share a rich history in textile weaving on the backstrap loom. Traditional women’s huipiles from Oxchuc feature alternating red or purple and white woven stripes with multicolored rays embroidered around the neckline and blocks of contrasting color below. Contemporary huipil design in Oxchuc includes more complex embroidery, with additional detail added to vertical woven stripes and around the sleeves. More experimental, modern blusas substitute traditional, white backgrounds for base colors in bright reds and purple hues.  Learn more about \"Empowering Threads: Textiles of Jolom Mayaetik\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/EmpoweringThreads",
