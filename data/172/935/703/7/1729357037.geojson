        "body": "In his series, \"This World and Others Like It\", artist Drew Nikonowicz draws upon the language of nineteenth-century survey images to investigate the role of the explorer in present times. Seamlessly merging computer-generated images with large format analog photographs, Nikonowicz explores the contemporary landscape without discriminating between images born in virtual reality and those made in a more traditional fashion. Nikonowicz renders each image in a consistently straightforward aesthetic regardless of how it came to beâ€”some are extracted as screen shots from online video games, others are modeled in CAD, and others were shot on film in mountainous regions across the United States.  See \"This World and Others Like It\" by Drew Nikonowicz on display, pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://ow.ly/SGyA50kjZrZ . . .",
