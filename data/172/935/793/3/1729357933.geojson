        "body": "Introduced on Valentine’s Day 1975, Pan American World Airways' new mix-and-match uniform was designed by multiple Academy Award-winning costumer Edith Head (1897–1981). This versatile uniform in polyester consists of a long-line cardigan-style jacket. Worn until 1980, it offered a slacks option, as well as a tunic with long sleeve blouse. Head incorporated Pan Am’s Universe Design motif seen on the belt buckle, scarf, and in the top-stitching on the felt slouch hat designed by Frank Olive (1929–1995).
