        "body": "Zuber et Cie began producing panoramic papers in the 1800s and continues to produce wallpaper to this day. This unique wallpaper created a breathtaking panoramic experience with all the walls in a room covered with non-repeating scenes. These mural-like papers transformed rooms. Generating a set of scenic wallpaper requires anywhere from over one hundred to several thousand printing blocks to create a scenic paper set. The firm uses the original antique printing blocks, which the French Ministry of Culture has designated as Historical Monuments. Over 150,000 woodblocks are stored in the factory’s historic cellars. “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
