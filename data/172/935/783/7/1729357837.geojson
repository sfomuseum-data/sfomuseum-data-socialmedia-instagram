        "body": "The Sud Aviation Caravelle was one of the first successful commercial jetliners produced in Europe. Development began in 1951, and the first prototype flew in 1955. The jetliner was introduced by SAS (Scandinavian Airlines System), followed by Air France in mid-1959. The improved Caravelle III was introduced by Swissair in 1960 and initially operated on the carrierâ€™s Zurich to London route. United Air Lines was the only major U.S. carrier to purchase the aircraft and inaugurated service in 1961. The Caravelle was a medium-range jetliner that featured design elements distinctly different from all other jetliners of its era and highly influential in the development of later jet aircraft. These innovations included twin, rear-mounted turbofan engines, a clean-swept wing, an exceedingly aerodynamic nose section, and a high-mounted horizontal stabilizer. Another defining characteristic of the Caravelle was its triangular-shaped passenger windows.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
