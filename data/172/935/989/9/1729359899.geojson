This black and white promotional photograph of two models in a Sleeperette seat showcased the modernity, comfortability, and luxury of Pan Amâ€™s planes. Trademarked by the airline in 1948, the Sleeperette was designed to be used as a traditional upright seat during daytime service and then to fold out, or recline, nearly flat into a bed-like configuration with an extendable leg and foot rest for nighttime sleeper service. Soon after, this type of seat became standard equipment on most long-distance sleeper-service airliners. #WomenInAviation #Boeing #PanAm #Sleeperette #avgeek #aviationhistory  Pan American World Airways, Pacific - Alaska Division c. 1949 SFO Museum Collection Gift of William E.
