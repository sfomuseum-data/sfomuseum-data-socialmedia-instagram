        "body": "Studio craft combines the characteristics of traditional, handmade craft with the refined qualities of fine art. Made by professional artist-craftspeople who work in a variety of media, studio craft includes both utilitarian items and more experimental pieces that focus on aesthetics over function. Studio craft makers transform raw materials such as clay, metal, wood, fiber, and glass into vessels, furniture, sculpture, and other decorative arts. For many, studio craft is an imaginative and personal expression that encourages creativity through the exploration of time-tested materials and techniques. The finest works evoke emotion and exhibit the process of making along with evidence of the artist’s hand.  This exhibition was made possible through a generous loan from Forrest L. Merrill. Thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for his support of this project, and to the Marvin Lipofsky Estate and Modern i Shop for their additional loans.  See “California Studio Craft: Featuring Works from the Forrest L. Merrill Collection” on display now, post-security, in the Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/CaliforniaCrafts",
