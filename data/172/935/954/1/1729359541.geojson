        "body": "The semi-nomadic Manchu conquerors who founded the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) embraced much of the cultural and artistic practices of the Han Chinese. However, they rejected female foot binding, in which young girls’ feet were bound to keep them extremely small. Foot binding conveyed a woman’s prominent place in Han society and made her more desirable to men. Instead of forcibly reshaping the foot, elite Manchu women conveyed their prestige by wearing platform shoes. The upper parts of the shoes were often elaborately embroidered with a variety of motifs and made of colorful silk or satin brocade. The platform shoes produced a stilted gait that slightly emulated the desirable “lotus walk” of women with bound feet. Such shoes also helped to keep feet and clothing hems clean and dry.
