In the early 1970s, this company divided into two airlines, one of which was Singapore Airlines. The Singapore Girl uniform was introduced in 1968; her iconic Sarong Kebaya was designed by French couturier Pierre Balmain. The uniform comes in four colors, blue, green, red, and burgundy, to represent the job designation of each Singapore Girl. Have you ever flown on Singapore Airlines?
