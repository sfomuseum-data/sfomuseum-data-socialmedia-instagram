Acconci began his artistic career as a poet, and came to national prominence in the early 1970s as an artist working in performance and conceptual art. Along this pre-security corridor in the International Terminal, sculptural beams of light splay out from the recessed lighting in the ceiling above and transverse the length of the corridor, like rays of light. At the end of each \"light beam\" is a non-functioning pay phone; the Airport's long term plans include restoring the functionality of these telephones. http://bit.ly/2pdfzYT",
