        "body": "In 1970, industrialist and aviation entrepreneur Howard Hughes (1905–1976) bought Air West, added his name to the airline, and kept its home base at San Francisco International Airport. Hughes selected Mario Armond Zamparelli (1921–2012) as chief executive designer. Also a photographer, poet, and jazz musician, Zamparelli created a forceful identity for Hughes Airwest, dominated by his blazing Sundance Yellow and Universe Blue color scheme. For this uniform, he added an orange poly-cotton blend zip-up jumper as a serving topper over the polyester blouse. The woven-ribbon trim bears the futuristic double-H logotype of the owner’s initials.  See \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\", pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/fashioninflight",
