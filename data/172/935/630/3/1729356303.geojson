        "body": "Developed and produced by Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd. of Great Britain, the Viscount was the world’s first turboprop airliner to go into service. Initially conceived during the latter years of World War II, Vickers Viscount took off on its maiden flight #onthisday in 1948. The mid-range airliner featured a pressurized aluminum fuselage, a capacity for up to seventy-five passengers (in later variants), a tricycle-type undercarriage, and four powerful Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines that produced nearly 2,000 horsepower each. In operation, the airliner performed smoothly, handled exceptionally well, and gained a high degree of popularity among its passengers. \"Aluminum: The Miracle Metal of Aviation\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AviationAluminum",
