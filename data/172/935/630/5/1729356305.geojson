        "body": "The house fly (Musca domestica), well known throughout the world, was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 as part of his Systema Naturae series of publications. The date of this German Stubenfliege (house fly) model is unknown, but it accurately depicts the wing veins and other anatomical features that identify this species. House flies locate sugar with their feet, which are ten million times more sensitive than the taste buds on the human tongue.  See “The Intriguing World of Insects” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/IntriguingInsects",
