Fraktur employs a combination of ink and watercolor and can be recognized by its elaborate decoration. Fraktur appears in the form of birth, marriage, and baptismal certificates, in addition to house blessings, awards of merit, and school writing samples. Because these were special documents, their owners typically adhered them to the inside of a chest or tucked them inside of a Bible; as a result, many survive today.  Fraktur courtesy of the collection of the Landis Valley Village and Farm Museum, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
