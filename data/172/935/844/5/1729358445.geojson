The cat is closely modeled after the beloved Fukusuke, another Japanese lucky figure; its exact date of origin is unknown. Originally produced at a shrine in Osaka, its popularity led to the production of Hatsutatsu-san at other kilns, such as Fushimi.  This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum (@mingeimuseum). \"Maneki Neko: Japanese Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
