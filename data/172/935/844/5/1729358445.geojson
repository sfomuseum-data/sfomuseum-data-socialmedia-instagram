        "body": "Hatsutatsu-san, an unusual derivative of a beckoning cat, wears colorful clothing and sits as if human with its legs crossed and tucked underneath his body. The cat is closely modeled after the beloved Fukusuke, another Japanese lucky figure; its exact date of origin is unknown. Originally produced at a shrine in Osaka, its popularity led to the production of Hatsutatsu-san at other kilns, such as Fushimi.  This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum (@mingeimuseum). \"Maneki Neko: Japanese Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
