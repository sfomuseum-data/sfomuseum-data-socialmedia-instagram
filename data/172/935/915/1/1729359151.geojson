        "body": "William Morris (1834–96) was a leading figure of the Arts and Crafts movement. Opposed to the hastily mass-produced books produced by modern printing presses, Morris sought to revive the tradition of fine printing and artistry found in medieval texts and manuscripts. Arts and Crafts graphic design was less a unified style than a set of ideals emphasizing good design and a collaborative effort between writer, designer, and printer. Many books were produced in limited editions and illustrated with woodcuts or engravings. The Arts and Crafts era witnessed a golden age in children’s book illustration.
