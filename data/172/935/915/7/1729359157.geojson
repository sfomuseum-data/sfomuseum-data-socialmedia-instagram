        "body": "It is the second week of installation for our \"#EmpoweringThreads: #Textiles of Jolom Mayaetik\" exhibition. It will open in its entirety on Saturday.  A unique and dedicated community of Mayan artisans are weaving brilliantly colored textiles in Los Altos de Chiapas, MÃ©xico. Working on backstrap looms, these weavers are utilizing methods passed down through generations to combine old-world symbolism with new colors and designs. Traditional Mayan weaving is produced on the backstrap loom, a simple and portable device used for centuries that creates complex work in the hands of a skilled artisan. In the past, weavers made woven items for themselves, for family members, and to trade. Now they are also produced for sale, and backstrap weaving has become a primary means for indigenous women to earn supplementary income.  See \"#EmpoweringThreads: #Textiles of Jolom Mayaetik\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/EmpoweringThreads",
