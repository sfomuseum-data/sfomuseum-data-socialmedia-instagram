        "body": "Mexican fashion designer Macario Jiménez studied at Milan’s Marangoni Institute and created his own clothing brand in 1994 specializing in women’s ready-to-wear. His Aeroméxico uniform, worn from 2008 to 2011, is a black polyester knit suit worn with a skirt or pants. The trim, tailored look of the jacket and skirt is highlighted with red piping, a two-tone tie belt, and dramatic kick pleat. The outfit is finished with the multicolor scarf. \"#FashionInFlight: A History of Airline Uniform Design\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/FashionInFlight1",
