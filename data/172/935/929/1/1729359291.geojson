        "body": "For centuries the public bath or hammam served an important role in Middle Eastern culture. In addition to bathing, hammams were gathering places where both men and women could separately socialize and relax. Special wooden bathing clogs called nalin were made with elevated heels similar to Japanese geta. Their high stature protected the wearer’s feet from the wet floors, though it is hard to imagine how bathers managed to walk in nalin, especially on slippery marble surfaces. The various heights of nalin and the quality of decorative materials demonstrated the wearer’s prestige. Today, people often wear wooden clogs called takunya in Turkish baths, which are also worn outdoors.
