        "body": "Founded in 1908 by Camillo #Olivetti (1868–1943), Ing. C. Olivetti \u0026 Co. is associated with design more than any other typewriter company. Within a framework termed the “Olivetti style,” good design was central to all levels of production and advertising, and even extended to the factory floor and lifestyle of its workers. The Valentine is perhaps the most iconic Olivetti typewriter, envisioned by designer Ettore Sottsass (1917–2007) as an inexpensive and simple-yet-stylish portable. Based mechanically on the mid-1960s Lettera 32, the Valentine came in bright, pop-art colors and included an ABS plastic case that doubled as a waste-paper bin.
