        "body": "Motivated by the lack of color, whimsy, and alternatives to leather in footwear, artist Mickey McGowan taught himself to make shoes. Inspired by the world around him and his dreams, he made eccentric, imaginative shoes in his Mill Valley studio throughout the 1970s. Dubbed the Apple Cobbler, he crafted many shoes both for utility and as works of art. McGowan’s fervent interest in popular culture deeply influenced his footwear designs, which encompassed everything from rubber ducks to toy tanks, Campbell’s soup cans, and Popeye cartoons.  Shoes courtesy of Mickey McGowan (Apple Cobbler). See more shoes from all over the world in \"Stepping Out: Shoes in World Culture\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ShoesinCulture",
