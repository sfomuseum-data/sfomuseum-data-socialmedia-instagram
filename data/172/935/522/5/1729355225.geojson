In 1967, the governments of France, West Germany, and the United Kingdom signed a memorandum of understanding to launch the development of the A300 as a joint aircraft program. The work was divided between France (37.5%), Germany (25%), and Britain (37.5%). Have you ever flown on an A300?  Image: Zurich - Kloten Airport postcard, Airbus A300, Air France, 1970s.
