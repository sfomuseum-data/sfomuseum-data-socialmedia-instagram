        "body": "Happy Birthday to the Golden Gate Bridge! The Golden Gate Bridge is an internationally recognized symbol of San Francisco. The bridge spans almost two miles of water between Marin County and San Francisco and held the title of the longest suspension bridge for almost 30 years. This immense undertaking started in 1933 and finished in 1937.  This black and white photograph of a ground-level view of construction of the Golden Gate Bridge was taken on October 21, 1935, almost two years before construction was officially complete.
