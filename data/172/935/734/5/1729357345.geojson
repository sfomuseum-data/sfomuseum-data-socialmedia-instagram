The TriStar trijet was the last commercial airliner produced by the Lockheed Corporation. An advanced feature of the L-1011 was the autoland system which fully automated the landing procedure and allowed the plane to land in unfavorable weather conditions. Only 250 L-1011 TriStar jets were produced and production halted in 1982. Did you ever fly on a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar?  Image: Pan American World Airways postcard, Lockheed L-1011-500 TriStar.
