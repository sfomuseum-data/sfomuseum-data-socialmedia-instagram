According to Chris Strachwitz, “Narciso was a fast and snappy player…so efficient at the accordion that he was able to record twenty titles in one day.” When he became the house accordionist for Ideal Records in San Benito, Texas, in 1946, he accompanied many popular singers, such as sisters Carmen \u0026 Laura Hernández, on commercial records. By doing so, he popularized what is now known as conjunto/norteño with an accordionist and bajo sexto player backing a duet. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
