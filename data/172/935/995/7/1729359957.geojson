        "body": "In 1970, Jean Louis (1907–1997) re-imagined United Air Lines' uniform for the wide-body jet era. The mix-and-match collection’s base garment is a double-knit jumper in red with a black-trimmed scoop neck. The matching wrinkle-resistant jacket has patch pockets and brass buttons. A bodysuit blouse came in short sleeve white or black sweater turtleneck versions, both made of polyester. Louis added a signature print scarf selection and eliminated the hat from the previous uniform.
