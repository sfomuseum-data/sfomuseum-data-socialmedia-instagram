        "body": "As myths associating the cat with witchcraft and evil started to wane in 17th century Great Britain, cats appeared more frequently in art and on decorative items. Small statues and milk jugs with feline forms were made from delftware, a tin-glazed earthenware that mimicked the more expensive porcelain imported from China. Far more durable than delftware, yet traditionally less colorful, stoneware is a high-fired ceramic made from clay and a fusible stone that was introduced to Great Britain in the late 1600s.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons  Tabby cat, 20th century Charles Vyse (1882â€“1971) Staffordshire, England stoneware L2018.0601.020 . . .",
