These changes also heralded a new corporate look with a fresh livery for the aircraft, along with a new line of cabin and ground crew uniforms. Created by French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, the flight attendant uniforms consisted of a dress or blouse with a colorful blue, red, yellow, and brown print on white incorporating a newly updated kangaroo logo. The uniform was complemented by a smart royal-blue jacket with a burnt-orange collar and sleeve cuffs. The airlineâ€™s kangaroo logo was affixed on the lapel. A matching scarf with the kangaroo pattern on black completed the ensemble.  Image: Qantas Airways, Yves Saint Laurent flight attendant uniform, 1987.
