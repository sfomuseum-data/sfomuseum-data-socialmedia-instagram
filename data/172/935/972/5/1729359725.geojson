        "body": "Hundreds of Native American rodeos take place nationwide, particularly in the larger western states. One of these regional rodeos, the Crow Fair, held in Montana, attracts competitors from as far as Pine Ridge in South Dakota and Fort Hall in Idaho. The Crow Fair rodeo includes track races, sprint races, bull riding, saddle bronc riding, team roping, ladies’ breakaway or calf roping, and the extraordinary Indian relay. In relay competition, each team consists of one fearless rider, three unsaddled horses, and three courageous teammates who restrain the two additional horses as the rider slides off one horse, and leaps onto the next. The intent is for the rider to smoothly transfer and gallop around the track on each of the team’s three horses.",
