        "body": "Today marks the eighty-fourth anniversary of Pan American Airways’ daring transpacific endeavor. Crowds of people watched from around the Bay Area as the Martin M-130 “China Clipper” lifted off from the waters of San Francisco Bay and strained into the sky threading its way under and over two partially built bridges. It soared through the Golden Gate and slowly disappeared from land as the ship’s crew of seven set course for the Far East and opened the age of regular transpacific oceanic commercial air service. The aircraft is shown here on its cradle being prepped for its launch from Alameda.  Learn more about early transpacific aviation in \"China Clipper\" on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/chinaclipper  Image: Pan American Airways, Martin M-130 China Clipper, Alameda, 1935, Gift of Beatrice H.
