        "body": "When introduced in 1949 by Pan American World Airways, the four-engine Boeing 377 Stratocruiser was considered one of the most luxurious long-range airliners. The aircraft was also very demanding to fly and maintain. It required a flight crew of five to operate and an exhaustive maintenance schedule. A Pan American Boeing 377 operations manual contained sections on cruise control, emergency procedures, operating procedures, performance, radio, systems, and design. “By the Book: Airliner Flight, Maintenance, and Training Manuals” has been extended until December. See the exhibition on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library.  Image: Pan American World Airways Boeing 377 Stratocruiser cockpit simulator, c. 1949.
