One of the original 13 British Colonies to be established on the East Coast of North America, North Carolina was also the location of the first English Colony in North America, established in 1585. The birth of powered, controlled, heavier-than-air flight also occurred here when the Wright brothers successfully flew their “Wright Flyer” at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on December 17, 1903.
