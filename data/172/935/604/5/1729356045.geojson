        "body": "People have moved many species around the world to help control pest insects. This practice is called Classical Biological Control, or Biocontrol. The first modern day success story of biocontrol was the introduction of the Vedalia beetle (Rodolia cardinalis Mulsant, 1850), a species of ladybug, from Australia into California in 1888 to control cottony cushion scale, a major insect pest of oranges and other citrus trees. Another species, the convergent ladybug (Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville, 1842), is collected in vast quantities in California and shipped around the world for pest control.  See “The Intriguing World of Insects” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/IntriguingInsects",
