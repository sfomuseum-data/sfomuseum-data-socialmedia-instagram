        "body": "The first #PanAm delivery of a Douglas DC-3 was #onthisday in 1937. With its aerodynamically superior design, the DC-3 revolutionized the airline industry in the late 1930s and was the first airliner to make a profit from passenger service. More than 400 DC-3s were initially ordered by most major airlines. By 1940, nearly three million passengers had flown in DC-3s, and the aircraft had collectively logged over one hundred million miles. The aircraft could seat twenty-one people comfortably in the standard seven-row, one-by-two across day-use configuration and as many as thirty-one in later two-by-two across seat configurations. By end of production, more than 10,000 commercial and military transport versions of the DC-3 had been built. Some are still in operation, a major testament to the aircraftâ€™s durability.
