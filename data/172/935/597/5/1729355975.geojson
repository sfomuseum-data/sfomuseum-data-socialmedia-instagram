        "body": "Renaissance Revival, the most ubiquitous furniture style following the Civil War, drew inspiration from the Renaissance of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as well as from the classical world. Nineteenth-century archaeological discoveries in Greece, Italy, and Egypt prompted designers to adapt and reinterpret designs and motifs from the past. Renaissance Revival’s rather masculine characteristics and grand scale make it easy to identify. Decorative elements took precedence over functionality. Mythical creatures, garlands, foliage, wild game, classical busts, scrolls, tassels, and portrait medallions appeared in high-relief carving. The incorporation of columns, pediments, and pilasters enhanced pieces. Gilded incising, marquetry, burled panels, wood veneering, ebonized wood, and marble tops commonly embellished pieces. Furniture was typically made with dark woods, such as walnut and rosewood. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
