        "body": "Continental was one of numerous U.S. airlines to launch Boeing 747 jumbojet service in 1970.  To promote its widebody operations, the airline introduced a new line of uniforms. Stewardesses were offered a choice of several ensembles. A form-fitting, polyester mini-dress projected a flashy, energetic look of casual comfort with bright stripes in Continental’s colors. Worn with patterned scarves featuring the airline’s circular contrails logo and complemented with red pumps, the uniforms were issued until 1973 and were in use during the introduction of the airline’s next widebody airliner, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
