        "body": "Happy Birthday #United Airlines! Did you know that United is the longest serving airline at San Francisco International Airport? Boeing Air Transport entered into an agreement with San Francisco on March 11, 1927 to make Mills Field its western terminus on the condition that the facility was completed by July 1 to the specifications of the airmail contract. However, no hangar space was available until September, so Boeing was forced to use Concord and Oakland. Boeing later tried to establish a base at Mills Field in October of that year to become the airportâ€™s first major airline but was fraught with weather challenges and returned to Oakland by November of 1927. Later, Boeing Air Transport would merge into a company that would one day return as United Air Lines.  Image: Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco, Boeing C.A.M. 18, 9/16/1927.
