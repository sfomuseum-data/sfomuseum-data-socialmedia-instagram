        "body": "First delivered on January 31, 1949, the first flight of Pan American Airway's Boeing 377 was from SFO to Honolulu #onthisday in 1949. The 377, named the #Stratocruiser, was Boeing's first commercial post-war airliner. With passenger accommodations for up to 100, depending on the seating configuration, the Stratocruiser also featured a lower deck lounge, complete with a cocktail bar. Because of this lower lounge, the aircraft was often used by airlines for luxury or first class service. The cost per airplane was $1.5 million dollars at the time, or about $15.4 million dollars today.  Image: Pan American World Airways advertisement, Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, Collierâ€™s,  1949.
