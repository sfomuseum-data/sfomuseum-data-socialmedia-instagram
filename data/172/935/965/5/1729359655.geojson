With manufacturing equipment designed by her husband Brian Heath (1913–2001), the Heaths made simple and elegant #housewares at their factory in Sausalito, California, for over fifty years.  All objects are from the collection of Steve Cabella. See more #midcentury #modern #design in \"#AModernApproach: Mid-Century Design\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AModernApproach",
