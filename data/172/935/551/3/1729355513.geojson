Soriano, a Spanish Filipino businessman, was president of the San Miguel brewery and loaned his personal Beech 18 for PAL's conception. By 1948, PAL was flying DC-6s from Manila to SFO via Guam, Wake Island, and Honolulu, a similar route to the one used by the Pan American Airways’ transpacific Clipper flying boats during the late 1930s and early ‘40s. Have you ever flown on Philippine Air Lines?  Image: Philippine Air Lines promotional print, Douglas DC-6, c. 1950. Gift of Thomas G. Dragges. 2014.110.075",
