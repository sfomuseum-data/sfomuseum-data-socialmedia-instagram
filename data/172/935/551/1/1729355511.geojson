Page had a small flying boat designed around one of his own aero engines and flew extensively around the Bay Area, photographing points of interest. Do you recognize either of these locations?  See “Above the Bay: The Aerial Photography of Stanley Page” on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. . . .",
