        "body": "What was it like navigating open waters in an aircraft during the 1930s? Complicated to say the least! In addition to celestial navigation and a radio compass, Pan American Airways pilots used a process called dead reckoning, which involved calculating a position based on a previously determined position, or fix, using data such as speed, elapsed time, and wind drift. Wind drift was calculated by dropping a ceramic drift marker overboard. Filled with metallic powder, it created a highly visible slick on the ocean surface. This fixed point was viewed through a drift meter to measure ground speed and sideways diversion from a crosswind that could then be calculated for a heading correction.  1st ðŸ“¸: the crew of Pan Amâ€™s first survey flight to Hawaiâ€™i, flown in 1935: Radio Officer W.T. Jarboe Jr., Junior Flight Officer Harry R. Canaday, First Officer R.O.D. Sullivan, Captain Edwin C. Musick, Navigator Fred J. Noonan, Engineer Officer Victor A. Wright.  2nd ðŸ“¸: the navigation and radio kit used by Pan Am in the mid 1930s and early 1940s.
