        "body": "At first glance, the bronze figures atop this early 19th century clock appear to represent that familiar emblem of Rome’s foundation mythology—the she-wolf with infants Romulus and Remus. However, this wolf and these children are not Roman. Rome’s founding myth proved sufficiently attractive that it was adopted by Siena beginning in the 13th century. The Sienese version holds that Remus’ sons, Senius and Aschius, fled after their uncle Romulus killed their father. Hungry, they encountered their own she-wolf, who provided sustenance.
