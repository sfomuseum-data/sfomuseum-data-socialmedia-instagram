        "body": "Mike Kelley travels to airports throughout the globe, looking for scenes that accurately describe the landscape while providing a vantage point from which the airport’s traffic can be seen in a linear trajectory. Kelley uses a stationary camera to capture every aircraft movement over the course of a set period. Once back at his studio, Kelley layers every airplane photographed onto a background image to create a temporally expanded composite of the airport and its movement. Mike Kelley’s Airportraits utilizes multiple exposures to illustrate our busy skies with an accuracy that cannot be achieved in a single photograph. In this way, Kelley’s images reveal the social and economic importance of aviation and invite us to contemplate the scale of the only worldwide transportation network.  See “Airportraits”, by photographer Mike Kelley, pre-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2pRVZzg",
