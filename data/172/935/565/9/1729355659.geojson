The Martin company produced numerous types of aircraft, including the Martin M-130, which Pan American Airways used to inaugurate the first scheduled transpacific airmail service in 1935. The Glenn L. Martin Company merged with the American-Marietta Corporation in 1961 to form Martin Marietta. In 1995 it merged with Lockheed to form the Lockheed Martin Corporation.
