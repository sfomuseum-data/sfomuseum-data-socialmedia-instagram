        "body": "Stanley Henry Page was San Francisco Bay Area engineer who was inspired by the new technologies of flight. In the 1920s, Stanley Page merged his love of flying with glass plate photography. Page had a small flying boat designed around one of his own aero engines and flew extensively around the Bay Area, photographing points of interest. Page’s images depict San Francisco Bay before its iconic bridges were built. Some of the locations he photographed, like Sutro Baths, have been lost to history, but many, like San Francisco’s famed Union Square and Cliff House, are still recognizable today. “Above the Bay: The Aerial Photography of Stanley Page” is on display, pre-security in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/StanleyHenryPage ",
