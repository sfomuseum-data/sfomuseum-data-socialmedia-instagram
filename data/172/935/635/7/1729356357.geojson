        "body": "Longhorn beetles belong to the family Cerambycidae and derive their name from their long antennae. Most longhorn beetle eggs are laid under pieces of bark. Their larvae feed inside the wood of dead and dying trees, including roots, trunks, and branches. Larvae first feed on the cambium (new growth layer under the bark) before boring deeper into the wood. Most species only attack trees that are weakened by disease, drought, or fire. But some species, such as the Asian longhorn beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis Motschulsky, 1853), which has invaded northeastern North America, can attack the healthy trees of many species. The intricate patterns on the elytra (wings) of many species help them to blend in with the bark of the trees on which they feed.
