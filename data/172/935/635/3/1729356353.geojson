        "body": "This Renaissance Revival pedestal exhibits both veneering and marquetry. A veneer consists of a very fine sheet of wood applied to the surface of furniture. Marquetry entails cutting wood veneers, in various colors and grain patterns, into decorative designs and adhering them to a piece of furniture or decorative art object. Materials such as mother-of-pearl, ivory, tortoise shell, and fine metals might also be applied. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
