        "body": "It is your last week to see “Reflections in Wood: Surfboards and Shapers.” By pairing iconic shapers with select sources of rare wood, Larry Fuller has assembled a collection of boards that illustrate the progression of surfboard design through a common medium. This exhibition features twenty-seven wooden surfboards constructed by Fuller and his partners over the past decade. See “Reflections in Wood: Surfboards and Shapers” on display pre-security in the International Terminal.  http://bit.ly/SurfboardsAndShapers",
