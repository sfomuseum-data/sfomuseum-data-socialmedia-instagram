Cats were the preferred pets of many artists, writers, and fashionable women and were regarded for their cleanliness and independent personalities. The popularity of felines in Europe surged with the worldâ€™s first cat show, held at the Crystal Palace in London in 1871. By the end of the century, items that featured cats were in high demand, and a wide variety of decorative arts with feline subjects was created, including these inkwells.
