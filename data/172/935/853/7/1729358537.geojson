In the early 1950s, Pan American World Airways introduced \"The President\" service aboard their double-deck Boeing 377 Stratocruisers. Passengers could enjoy \"the most luxurious air service in the world\" on their transpacific, South American, and transatlantic flights.  All other exhibitions around the airport are still open.
