        "body": "Bruce Beasley has lived in the Bay Area since his student days at the University of California, Berkeley. Beasley gained recognition early in his career for his innovative work in large-scale acrylic sculpture. He turned to working with metals in the mid-1970s. The Hesperides was one of the first large scale works commissioned for the Airport. While not meant to represent any particular \"flying machine,\" the artist's intent was to evoke a sense of lightness, movement, and the grace of flight. \"The Hesperides\" by Bruce Beasley is located pre-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2Eb7xsJ",
