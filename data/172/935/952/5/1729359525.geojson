        "body": "Maria Longworth Nichols (1849–1932) founded Rookwood Pottery in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1880. Before long, it became the largest and most influential pottery in the country. Longworth named the pottery after the country estate of her father, Joseph Longworth, who had provided the funds to establish the pottery. A number of talented employees worked for Rookwood, such as leading ceramicist Artus Van Briggle (1869–1904), who remained at the firm for over a decade before leaving to found his own pottery in Colorado. Chemist Karl Langenbeck (1861–1938) and Mary Louise McLaughlin (1847–1939), who founded the Cincinnati Women’s Pottery Club in 1879, also worked at Rookwood. The pottery incorporated a variety of themes, such as Asian and floral motifs. Rookwood produced large numbers of ceramics in the Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, and later Art Deco styles. In addition to hand-painted decoration, many of its Arts and Crafts-style pieces were carved and decorated with plants, flowers, and sea creatures and feature bright, thick glazes. The pottery sold wares at its Cincinnati showroom and at department stores throughout the country.  These three vases are courtesy of Kris Steensma.
