        "body": "Zuber et Cie currently produces fourteen scenic wallpaper sets using original antique printing blocks. It often takes more than one thousand blocks to create a scenic paper set. For instance, if there are several colors on one leaf in a scenic paper, each color is applied with a separate woodblock by hand. Printing blocks were created in layers in order to prevent the blocks from warping. Whitewood or pine was used underneath, and sycamore or pear tree wood was preferred as the top carved layer due to the fineness of the grain. “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” is on display, pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
