        "body": "Something not often considered by museum-goers is how long it can take to develop an exhibition. One of our upcoming exhibits is about hair in popular culture; it has been years in the making and is scheduled for late 2020. The exhibition will feature historical items related to hair as well as vintage collectibles. All the items will be from the collection of Jeff Hafler, owner of the Beauty Bubble Salon and Museum in Joshua Tree, California. The show will also include hair sculptures made by him; as Hafler explains, “For years people have been donating their old hair stuff to my collection. I had accumulated boxes and bags full of rollers, rods, curlers, clips, combs, barrettes and do dads! All that stuff inspired these sculptures. My “Hairsterical” gals are keeping some of that beauty waste out of our oceans and landfills.” See our Hair exhibition, coming next year!",
