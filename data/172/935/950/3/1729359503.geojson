        "body": "#OnThisDay, the first female cabin crewmember, Ellen Church, worked her first flight for Boeing Air Transport(BAT). Hired by BAT at its San Francisco office in 1930, she pioneered the “stewardess” profession by selecting seven more women for hire. During the 1930s, stewardesses at many airlines were required to be trained nurses and unmarried, and in the 1940s, airlines sought “young, petite, and attractive” applicants. Their jobs included weighing passengers and luggage, loading and unloading bags, helping to fuel airplanes, and occasionally pushing them airplane into hangars.
