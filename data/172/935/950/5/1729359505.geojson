To celebrate The Summer of Love, SFO Museum is presenting \"It Happened in Monterey\", photographs by Elaine Mayes from The Monterey International Pop Music Festival in May 1967. The Monterey Pop Festival was organized to showcase rock music and soul music as art forms, bringing together acts from the United Kingdom and major regional music centers in the United States—Los Angeles, Memphis, New York City, and of course, San Francisco. Mayes managed to photograph nearly every performer, many of whom would profoundly affect the course of rock music and popular culture. Mayes’ photographs offer a remarkable level of intimacy with performers at this seminal event, remembered by Mayes as “among the best experiences of my life.” See \"It Happened in Monterey\" photographs by Elaine Mayes, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/ElaineMayes",
