        "body": "Cats are the most independent domesticated animals. With their characteristically nonchalant personalities and keen abilities to hunt and fend for themselves, cats do not necessarily need humans to survive. Cats are both mysterious and honest, and many people find the unique friendships offered by their feline companions to be quite rewarding. Numerous artists have also fallen under the cat’s spell and have made felines the subject of their work. French animalier Charles Valton (1851–1918), who was known for his sculpture of lions and other big cats, likely modeled this clock featuring a small, domesticated cat lovingly rubbing against its base. While working in Paris, the bohemian painter Gwen John (1876–1939) kept numerous cats and described her beloved tortoiseshell cat Edgar Quinet, who appears in these two sketches, as “an enigmatic little soul.” A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
