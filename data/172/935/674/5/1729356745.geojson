        "body": "Betty Trippe, the wife of Pan American founder Juan Trippe, was integral to the success of Pan American World Airways. She and pioneering aviatrix Anne Morrow Lindbergh (the wife of Charles Lindbergh) accompanied their husbands on the inaugural flight to Paramaribo, Suriname, in 1929. It was the southernmost mail-carrying route in South America to that date. Betty kept a lifelong meticulous diary and writes of her South American flight, “it was quite comfortable, but you could not move around as the ceiling was so low, the aisle was very narrow and the little wicker seats were very close together.” Betty accompanied Juan on many trips around the world as Pan American established new routes and forged new connections. Coming from a well-established political family, Betty was well versed in diplomacy and helped establish relationships with foreign heads of state.
