He went on to establish the Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corporation (later renamed the Sikorsky Manufacturing Company). One of the most important early Sikorsky aircraft, the S-42, was developed to meet the requirements of Pan American Airways’ president Juan T. Trippe for a large, long-range, trans-oceanic flying boat. Designed by Igor Sikorsky, with input from Charles A. Lindbergh, it could carry a crew of four and thirty-two passengers up to 1,200 miles. In 1935, the S-42 named Pan American Clipper was modified for extended range to survey the Pacific route and was later used for regular service on the Manila–Hong Kong leg. An S-42B flew South Pacific survey missions.  Image: The Sikorsky S-42 Pan American Airways Clipper flying through San Francisco Bay’s Golden Gate, 1935. SFO Museum Collection. 2013.117.010 ",
