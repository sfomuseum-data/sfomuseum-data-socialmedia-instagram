        "body": "Insects have exoskeletons—which, along with jointed legs, are the defining characteristics of insects and other arthropods. For most adult insects, the exoskeleton is very rigid and holds its shape even after they die. Hence, many specimens are preserved indefinitely by simply letting them dry. Entomologists usually use pins to handle specimens without damaging them and as a means to attach labels. But insects do not always die in a position convenient for viewing all their features. Because of this, entomologists use “spreading boards” to hold the wings of butterflies, moths, and other insects in place while they dry.  See “The Intriguing World of Insects” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/IntriguingInsects",
