Our newest exhibition “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” presents promotional objects and images from airlines that operated these three first widebody jetliners introduced in the early 1970s.  See “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” in on display, pre-security, is on the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
