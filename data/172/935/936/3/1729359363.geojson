As an artist, Samoylova questions the need to contribute to the nearly two billion photographs uploaded to the internet daily, choosing instead to work with images that already exist. Using online source material, she produces imagery that rearticulates the very concept of landscape photography—shifting the focus away from the picturesque landscapes we have come to expect and onto the romanticized genre of nature photography itself. In repurposing these commonplace pictures, Samoylova is careful to produce compositions that mesmerize, challenge, and ultimately encourage us to contemplate the unfathomable sum of images in circulation and the effect they have on our perception of nature.
