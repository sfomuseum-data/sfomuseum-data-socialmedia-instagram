        "body": "In 1873, the Sholes \u0026 Glidden Type Writer introduced “QWERTY,” a keyboard layout named for the first six letters at the top-left row of letter keys. Organized to prevent type-bars from clashing and jamming prototype machines, QWERTY was mechanically suited to the Sholes \u0026 Glidden and not necessarily designed for efficient typing. After a manufacturing contract with E. Remington \u0026 Sons of Ilion, New York, was secured, Remington mechanics extensively refined the machine for functionality and assembly-line production. The Type Writer was the basis for all Remington models until their front-stroke Standard was introduced in 1908. Contemporary computers, tablets, and smart phones share the QWERTY keyboard layout.
