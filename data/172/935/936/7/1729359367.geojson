        "body": "Over ninety years ago, at the dawn of commercial aviation, four companies merged into a single airline that became a preeminent U.S. carrier. With this consolidation of Boeing Air Transport, Pacific Air Transport, National Air Transport, and Varney Air Lines by 1931, United Air Lines was formed. \"Flying the Main Line\" presents artifacts and imagery from SFO Museum, United Airlines Archives, and the United Airlines Historical Foundation. The exhibition explores the company's history from its origins in the biplane and prewar piston-engine eras, with an emphasis on the formative Mainliner decades, through the jet age of global expansion to the present day.  Our newest exhibition \"Flying the Main Line: A History of United Airlines\" opens tomorrow, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/TheMainLine",
