        "body": "Limited edition, bronze animal sculptures were a specialty of many Art Nouveau artists. Rembrandt Bugatti (1884–1916), the son of furniture designer Carlo Bugatti (1856–1940) and younger brother to automobile maker Ettore Bugatti (1881–1947), was one of the most celebrated animal sculptors of the early 20th century. Self-trained in the arts, Bugatti made his first sculpture at age sixteen and exhibited in numerous European galleries including the prestigious Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
