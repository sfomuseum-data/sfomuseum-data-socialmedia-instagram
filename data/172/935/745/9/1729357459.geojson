        "body": "For generations of Californians and visitors to the Golden State, the Nut Tree Restaurant in Vacaville, California was a popular destination. Located along Interstate Highway 80 between San Francisco and Sacramento, it made an ideal roadside stop for motorists. Many visitors, however, reached the Nut Tree by air. In addition to restaurants and shops, it had its own airport that was a favorite among private pilots. In 1996, after 75 years of successful operation, the Nut Tree Restaurant closed. The airfield, donated to Solano County in 1973, continues operating as the Nut Tree Airport. Have you ever been to the Nut Tree Airport?  Image: Nut Tree Airport poster, 1969.
