        "body": "A recurring impulse in the work of American sculpture Isamu Noguchi is an irresistible compulsion to make three-dimensional sculptures from two-dimensional materials. Our exhibition features two types of installations representing interior and exterior landscapes. They are drawn from Noguchi's last two forays in sheet metal kirigami (cutting and folding), combined with his most successful and ubiquitous expansion of the practice of sculpture, his electrified paper-and-bamboo Akari lanterns.  Thank you to The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum for their generous loan. See \"Isamu Noguchi: Inside and Out\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal",
