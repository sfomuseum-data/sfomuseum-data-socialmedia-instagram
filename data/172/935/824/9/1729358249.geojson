        "body": "A stock certificate is a legal document printed on paper that represents equity ownership in a company. With ornate borders and usually bearing an illustration that is related to the company's business, such as an airplane, they are printed on bond paper from a finely engraved metal plate. When a stock is redeemed a perforated cancellation mark is made and it then becomes null and void as a financial instrument. Today, stocks are issued electronically and this has increasingly made stock certificates items of interest to collectors. This area of collecting is called scripophily, a combination of the English word \"scrip\" meaning ownership right and the Greek word \"philos\" meaning love. ",
