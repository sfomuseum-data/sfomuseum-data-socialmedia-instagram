        "body": "Our newest gallery space, located behind security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1, is getting ready for its inaugural exhibition, “Eclectic Taste: Victorian Silver Plate”. Before we install the objects, however, we need to ensure that the case adheres to strict environmental standards. We have two digital hygro thermometers reading the temperature and humidity within the case, and we’ll match the readings to those from the HVAC system. This will ensure that the new system is working properly and that the appropriate environmental range can be met and sustained.  Two other tests are also being run. The tissue paper (strapped to the vertical blue board) acts as a windsock and is quick way of making sure that the case’s HVAC system is not creating strong airflow that could damage an object. More difficult to see, and located behind the two digital readers, are metal coupons in a petri dish and are a way of checking that the case isn’t off-gassing. Tarnish or corrosion on the coupons would suggest that the case was emitting vapors that could be harmful to artwork. All of these tests help support findings from a formal air quality test run by a contractor.  “Eclectic Taste: Victorian Silver Plate” is coming soon!",
