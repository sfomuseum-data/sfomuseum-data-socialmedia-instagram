        "body": "The French-speaking settlers who left the Acadian region of Canada  for southwest Louisiana in 1764 became known as Cajuns. They brought  their traditional ballads and fiddle tunes with them. Music was an  essential part of social life among Cajuns at house parties, gatherings,  and by the 1920s, at dancehalls. Over time, French-speaking African  American Creoles also shared these music traditions. In the days before  amplification or microphones, singers had to project their voices high  and loud in order to be heard. Even after amplified sound was introduced  in the mid-1930s, this characteristic singing style remained the  standard among most traditional Cajun vocalists. Lyrics are still sung  in French today. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://ow.ly/Xj1p50jCwCg",
