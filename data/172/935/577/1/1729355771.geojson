        "body": "Gilding, which has existed since ancient times, entails applying extremely thin sheets of gold to the surface of another material. Gilding produces the appearance of solid gold, without its expense or weight. The lavish sheen left by gilding suited Victorian tastes where it was often used to accent furniture or applied more opulently over entire extravagant pieces, such as the pedestal displayed here. Much of the furniture of the Victorian era was accented with bronze paint to imitate gilding. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
