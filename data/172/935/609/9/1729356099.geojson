        "body": "Robert Bechtle’s early work was as a Bay Area figurative painter, but in the 1970s, he received national acclaim as a Photorealist. His use of ordinary subject matter, harsh lighting,and unstudied composition creates a sense of ironic distance typical of the genre, but Bechtle’s paintings also have a more personal quality. Shown here is Benton Street in San Francisco, one of the familiar local neighborhoods Bechtle frequently paints.  See “San Francisco Nova” by Robert Bechtle, on display, post- security in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2kgIzQ8",
