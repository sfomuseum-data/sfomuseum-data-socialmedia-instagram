        "body": "During the 1930s, the finest radio sets were influenced by popular aesthetic movements such as Art Deco, with designs rendered in streamlined and asymmetrical shapes. Finely crafted wooden cabinets with carefully radiused corners housed more powerful and advanced electronics. These artfully designed, wood-case sets were the flagships of tabletop radios and paired contrasting grill cloths with bright metals and lacquered woods. Many radios featured modern typefaces and stylized tuning indicators, with detailed dials. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
