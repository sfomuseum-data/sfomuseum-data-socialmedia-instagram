Collecting remnants of metal, glass, broken appliances, and disassembled machine parts, he photographs them in a studio setting to produce abstracted images of each item, stripped from its original context and reduced to elements of shape, line, texture, and tonality. \"The New Machinery\" by Martin Venezky is on display pre-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/2KPb1o9",
