As supermarkets replaced smaller, neighborhood grocery stores, product packaging was redesigned to sell items without the assistance of traditional grocers. Effective package design identified items from a maze of competitors. Colorful, illustrative graphics and catchy slogans promoted packaged goods on store shelves and while in use at home. Modern materials such as aluminum and plastic allowed for innovative and alluring packaging. While certain items proved no more than passing fads, other products became part of everyday life and popular culture. What is your favorite product packaging design? \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
