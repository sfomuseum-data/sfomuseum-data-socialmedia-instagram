        "body": "American Modern Gothic furnishings evolved from the nineteenth-century English design reform movement in England. English proponents such as Charles Locke Eastlake (1836¬–1906) and Bruce J. Talbert (1838–81) advocated for “honest” furniture construction with discernible joinery, simple finishes, quality materials, and modern adaptations of medieval motifs. Talbert’s influential publication Gothic Forms Applied to Furniture, Metal Work, and Decoration for Domestic Purposes (1867) showed furniture in modern medieval-style interiors, which served as a resource for American designers and consumers. The 1876 Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia further encouraged the novel style. Modern Gothic furniture commonly features carved architectural elements in the Gothic fashion such as pointed arches, crockets and finials, and scrolling leafage. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
