        "body": "Native Hawaiian surfing originated approximately one thousand years ago, imported from Tahiti by the Polynesian people who settled the Hawaiian Islands. He‘e nalu, which translates to “wave sliding,” is a culturally distinct form of surfing that grew into a popular pastime for men and women of all ages in Hawai‘i. Hawaiians enjoyed surfing on many types of ancient boards. Short paipo belly boards such as the uma were utilized for smaller surf. Omo boards could be ridden prone or while standing up. Sleek and maneuverable, stand-up alaia and pūua boards were preferred for higher speeds and larger surf. \"Reflections in Wood — Surfboards and Shapers\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal! http://bit.ly/SurfboardsAndShapers  Image: Pūua  2013 Tom “Pōhaku” Stone (b. 1951) curly redwood Courtesy of Charles Pyle L2018.2803.014",
