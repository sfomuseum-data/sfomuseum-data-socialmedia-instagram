Two different United logos are shown, the Saul Bass designed logo used from 1974 to 2010 (top, on the signage) and a much earlier one, introduced in the 1950s (very faded on the back of his coveralls). Which United logo is your favorite?  Image: San Francisco International Airport (SFO), United Airlines, c. 1985. SFO Museum Collection. 2011.068.118",
