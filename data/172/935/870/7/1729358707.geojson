        "body": "In this diorama-like construction, The Beatles are shown exiting an airplane on their first US tour in 1964. The colored rectangles superimposed onto this scene are based on Piet Mondrianâ€™s Composition C (1935). By combining an archival image with an abstract composition, this work attempts to free the photograph of its documentary status while adding a narrative to a set of seemingly static primary color fields. Mondrian Meets The Beatles also imagines a meeting that never took place between a painter and music band, each of which revolutionized their respective fields of culture. \"Mondrian Meets The Beatles\" by #KotaEzawa is on display, post-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/2C1B4nN",
