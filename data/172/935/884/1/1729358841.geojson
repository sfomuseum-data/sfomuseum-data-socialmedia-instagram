        "body": "In 1939, Hollywood producer, financial magnate, and visionary aviator Howard Hughes acquired a majority share of TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air). At the time, Lockheed was developing a large, high-speed, pressurized airliner designated the L-44 Excalibur. Hughes requested that the airliner be developed to TWAâ€™s specifications. Secretly designed under the leadership Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson, with ample direction from Hughes, the renamed 049 Constellation evolved into an extremely fast, highly advanced, and revolutionary large-capacity airliner with a unique dolphin-shaped fuselage and distinctive tripletail. The first production aircraft were requisitioned for the war effort as C-69 military transports. During the postwar era, Constellations were converted to civilian passenger configurations. Operated on domestic routes, as well as transatlantic routes between Europe and North America, the airliner played a major role in advancing long-range commercial aviation during the immediate postwar era.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
