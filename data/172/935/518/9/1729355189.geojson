In 2015, we presented “Life and Style in the Age of Art Deco” featuring objects showcasing the Art Deco style from the 1920 to the 40s. Dynamic and modern, Art Deco exuded glamour, pleasure, and escape. It took inspiration from the current, mechanized world, while at the same time drawing upon historic European styles, ancient and distant cultures, as well as contemporary avant-garde art. Do you remember this exhibition?  See “Life and Style in the Age of Art Deco” online: https://bit.ly/3fhtTaw",
