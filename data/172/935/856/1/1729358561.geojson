        "body": "American carved stone books first appeared around 1860. Stonecutters, many of whom worked in gravestone shops, created these intriguing items in their leisure hours. Stone books, usually carved in a closed position, are small, typically three- to six-inches in height. Marble, especially white, was used most often because it was readily available and easily carved. Given to loved ones as gifts, stone books typically served as objects of remembrance. Makers embellished books with a variety of religious and secular inscriptions and imagery-both incised or carved in relief. Some recurring motifs include crosses, clasped hands, hearts, horseshoes, and lambs.  Books courtesy of the collection Ian Berke. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
