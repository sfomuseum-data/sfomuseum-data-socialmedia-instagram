        "body": "Oakland School for the Arts (OSA) is a nonprofit public school founded by the city's former Mayor, California Governor Jerry Brown. Students in the School of Visual Art learn to create artwork using a variety of techniques and media, including drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, and digital design. The instructors are professional working artists as well as arts educators. The work featured in this exhibition was produced by OSA students from grades nine through twelve. Responding to the prompt, \"FLY,\" students worked with a range of mediums from watercolor to collage. Interpretations of the theme not only reference flight, birds, insects, and airplanes, but also the urban vernacular use of the word, as in, \"They're so FLY!\". See art by students from Oakland School for the Arts, pre-security, on the arrivals level of Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2EqSHv3",
