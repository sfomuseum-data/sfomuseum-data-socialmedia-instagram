        "body": "Introduced in 1931, pinball was a pop-cultural phenomenon. This game is a smaller, upright variation of a standard, mid-1930s pinball machine and capitalizes on the popularity of aerial competitions in the early years of aviation. Influenced by Genco Corporation's Silver Cup, it was likely a prototype for a game that was not mass produced. The trophy cups, lower trough, and mechanical parts of Aerial Cup were salvaged and modified from other pinball machines.  All objects are courtesy of Joe Welch American Antique Museum in San Bruno, California. \"The Automatic Age: Coin-Operated Machines\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/CoinOperated",
