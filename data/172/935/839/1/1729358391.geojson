        "body": "The de Havilland DH-60G Moth was a two-seat biplane of mostly wood construction, with a plywood covered fuselage and cloth covered wings. The Moth readily provided a small, moderately-priced, sturdy, easy to fly aircraft to the public. In 1930, the British aviator Amy Johnson flew the Moth G-AAAH solo from England to Australia. She was the first woman to accomplish this feat. As a result, she received the Harmon Trophy and was made Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
