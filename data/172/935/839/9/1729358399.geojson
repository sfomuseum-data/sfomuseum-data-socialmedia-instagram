        "body": "The Mikawa kilns, located in central Japan, began producing unique versions of maneki neko by the early twentieth century. The cats typically display a buff or white color body with darker areas at the hips, shoulders, and back of the heads and ears. These full-bodied cats face forward and have short tails and salient facial features. Sometimes Mikawa maneki neko are made quite large-some more than twenty-five inches tall, making them the largest of all the traditional maneki neko. Because of their imposing size, they became popular gifts to celebrate the opening of an inn or restaurant.  This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum. \"Maneki Neko: Japanese Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
