        "body": "The field of aeronautical engineering led to some of the most profound technological advancements of the 20th century. One of the companies driving these changes was the Boeing Aircraft Company. Within the span of a single lifetime, Boeing went from producing piston-engine, propeller-driven aircraft constructed of fabric, metal tubing, and wood to modern jetliners. This United Airlines photo depicts what is often referred to as the first modern airliner, the model 247 that Boeing introduced in 1933, seen parked next to the 747 that Boeing introduced in 1970. The twin-engine Boeing 247 had a maximum speed of 200 miles per hour, a range of 745 miles, a wingspan of 74 feet, and carried 10 passengers. In comparison, the 747-100 had a typical cruising speed of 570 miles per hour, a wingspan of 196 feet, and carried 366 passengers in a three class configuration across continents and oceans.
