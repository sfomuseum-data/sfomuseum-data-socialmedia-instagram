The husband-and-wife team of Charles (1907–78) and Ray (1912–88) Eames had the greatest impact, perhaps most elegantly with the molded plywood LCW chair introduced in 1946. Using their molded plywood technology, the Eames office designed radio cabinets for companies such as Zenith, Emerson, and Bendix, and from 1946 to 1952, Evans Products manufactured more than 200,000 Eames-designed radio enclosures. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
