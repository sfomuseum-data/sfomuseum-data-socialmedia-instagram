        "body": "Construction on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge began #onthisday in 1933. The Bay Bridge, the lesser known but older bridge originating from San Francisco, has one of the longest spans in the United States and carries over 260,000 cars each day. Designed by Charles H. Purcell, it opened six months before the Golden Gate Bridge, on November 12, 1936. After part of the East Span of the bridge collapsed from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, work began on the bridge for seismic retrofit and the East Span was ultimately replaced, reopening in 2013. Have you ever traveled across the Bay Bridge?  Image: Oakland - San Francisco Bay Bridge approach, 1940. SFO Museum Collection. 2013.117.039",
