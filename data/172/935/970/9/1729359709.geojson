This is hardly surprising given that the rapid development of aviation technology was one of the great symbols of hopeful progress in the 20th century. The massive Boeing 314 flying boats were Pan American Airways’ premier aircraft in the late 1930s and ‘40s and were frequently given pride of place in the company’s promotional materials. In this image, one of the big Boeings sits in the western terminus of Pan American’s trans-Pacific route, Hong Kong Harbor.  See \"The #YearsFlyBy: Airline Calendars from the Collection\" on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/YearsFlyBy ",
