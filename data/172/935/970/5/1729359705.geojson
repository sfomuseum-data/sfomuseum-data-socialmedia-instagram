        "body": "The Trevi Fountain in Rome, Italy was designed as a Papal commission by architect Nicola Salvi (1697–1751) in 1730. Giuseppe Panini (1733–62), completed the project after Salvi’s death in 1751. This model of Rome’s largest Baroque fountain features its central figures, all from Ancient Greek mythology. Oceanus (personification of the seas) upon his shell chariot is pulled by a pair of winged Hippocamps (horse-bodied and fish-tailed) and guided by two Tritons (human-bodied and fish-tailed). The model also gives dramatic form to the water making its way to the basin below.  All objects are from the Collection of Piraneseum. See \"All Roads Lead to #Rome: 17th–19th Century Architectural Souvenirs from the Collection of #Piraneseum\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AllRoadsRome ",
