        "body": "Introduced in 1952, the de Havilland Comet was the first commercial  passenger jetliner to enter service, years before the introduction of  other jetliners. Initially seen as a major landmark in aeronautical  engineering, after intermittent operation and structural failures,  service and production were canceled until airframe-engineering  deficiencies could be corrected. As a result, after many years of  redesigning, the much-improved, lengthened, Comet 4 was finally  delivered to BOAC in 1958. Shortly after, the airline inaugurated  regular transatlantic jet service from London to New York with one  refueling stop in Newfoundland. BEA inaugurated shorter-range Comet 4B  service on its Tel Aviv to London route in April 1960. The Comet 4  cruised at five hundred miles an hour and comfortably accommodated up to  eighty-one passengers, but ultimately, could not compete with the  Boeing 707 or the Douglas DC-8.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane  Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display,  pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://ow.ly/amRj50jff4P . . .",
