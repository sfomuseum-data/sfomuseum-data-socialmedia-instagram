        "body": "National #ComingOutDay was yesterday! The creator of the rainbow flag, Gilbert Baker, worked tirelessly to ensure the rainbow flag would become a powerful and enduring symbol of pride and inclusion that transcends languages and borders, gender and race, and now, four decades after its creation, generations. After suffering a stroke in 2012, Baker retaught himself how to sew, continued to make art every day, and witnessed the full appreciation of the symbol he created. This included its recognition as a historically important design icon when acquired by the Museum of Modern Art’s design collection in 2015, and a White House ceremony in which Baker presented President Barack Obama with a framed copy of his original eight-stripe rainbow flag in 2016. Shown here is the White House illuminated with the colors of the flag in celebration of the Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States. Photo by Pete Souza.
