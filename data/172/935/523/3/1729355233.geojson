        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1927, Charles A. Lindbergh landed in Paris, France, after completing the first solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by plane. In 1919, New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig, offered $25,000 to the first person to complete a non-stop transatlantic flight. On May 20, 1927, Lindbergh took off from New York in his \"Spirit of St. Louis\", a specially-built Ryan NYP (New York to Paris) single-engine aircraft. The 3,500-mile journey followed a route over the Canadian maritime provinces, then crossed more than 1,900 miles of open ocean. The next day, after thirty-three and a half hours, the 25-year-old pilot became an international star upon landing at Parisâ€™ Le Bourget Field. This amazing achievement changed the course of history and brought aviation to the forefront of public attention.  Image: Charles Lindbergh postcard, 1927. Gift of Frank A. Norick. 2011.128.006",
