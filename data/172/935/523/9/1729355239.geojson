After 15 hours and 2,026 miles, she landed near Londonderry, Northern Ireland. She left five years to the date after Charles Lindberghâ€™s flight. Not only was she the first woman to successfully fly across the Atlantic and she was the first person after Charles Lindbergh to successfully complete the trip solo.
