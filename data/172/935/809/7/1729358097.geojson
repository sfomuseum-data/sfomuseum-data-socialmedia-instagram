The “Love Bird” service out of Dallas Love Field offered twelve daily round-trip flights from Dallas to Houston and six round-trip flights from Dallas to San Antonio on Boeing 737-200s. Since starting service, Southwest has the distinction of almost exclusively operating the Boeing 737 family, except for a brief period when the airline operated Boeing 727s. Have you ever flown on Southwest Airlines?  Image: Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 model aircraft,1999. Gift of Southwest Airlines. 1999.031.006 a b",
