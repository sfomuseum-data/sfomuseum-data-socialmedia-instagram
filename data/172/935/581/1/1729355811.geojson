        "body": "Pan American Airways pioneered commercial airline service to Latin America and the Caribbean in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when air travel was first developing into a viable form of transportation. In less than three years, Pan American’s routes increased from an inaugural 261-mile Miami-Havana line to over 19,000 miles throughout two continents. By 1930, the Pan American Airways System linked twenty-nine Latin American and Caribbean countries and territories with regularly scheduled airmail, passenger, and cargo flights. Pan American Airways began service in Central America with the Ford 5-AT Tri-Motor, a robust, three-engine, twelve-passenger airliner affectionately known as the “Tin Goose.” Tri-Motors departed Cristóbal in the Panama Canal Zone for Guatemala two-to-three times per week, linking cities in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador.
