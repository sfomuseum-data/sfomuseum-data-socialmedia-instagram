        "body": "Dorothy Hope Parkinson Kewin (1922-1976) was the first Pan American World Airways stewardess officially assigned to Pacific route service. Originally from Sacramento, \"Hope\" Parkinson was hired in 1944 and trained in Miami. In 1948, Hope transferred from Miami to San Francisco to start work in Pan American's Pacific Division. Through the years, she moved up the Pan American ranks. After six months as a line stewardess, she was promoted to check stewardess. Then she became the Stewardess Coordinator and the Flight Service Supervisor of the Pacific-Alaska Division and helped to design the galley for the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser. Though Hope mentions in a 1952 article in Charm magazine that she would not date crew members as a rule, she “met” her husband, Thomas Kewin, a fellow Pan Am employee, in 1948. They were surprised to find that they had grown up together in the Sacramento region and had spent summers at Kewin's grandmother's house in Twaine Harte, California. Kewin, a Pan American Flight Engineer, later wrote an autobiography, \"The Pan Am Journey\", detailing their lives together",
