This photographic image is of a redwood forest on Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, California, just north of the City and County of San Francisco. The title for this artwork is taken from a line in a poem, The Redwoods, written by Joseph B. Strauss, the chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge. Visitors are invited to enjoy the natural splendor of The Golden State while at the airport.  See \"No Other Lands Their Glory Know\" by Alice Shaw, post-security, above Gate 95 in the International Terminal",
