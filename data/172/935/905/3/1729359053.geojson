The hat badges and the wings worn on the jacket and shirt complete the outfit. Over the decades, insignia styles have evolved as aircraft and service modernized. The color and finish of Unitedâ€™s hat badges and wings have changed over the years, but these insignia sets have always retained their classic aeronautical bearings.  Badge courtesy of the collection of United Airlines Archives. See \"Flying the Main Line: A History of United Air Lines\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/TheMainLine",
