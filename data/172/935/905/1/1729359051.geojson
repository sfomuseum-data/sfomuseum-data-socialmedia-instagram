        "body": "In 1962, San Francisco International Airport ranked as the fourth busiest airport in the U.S. The fleets of jet airliners used by both domestic and international carriers created demands for new boarding area configurations at SFO. With an increase in speed and far more economical ticket prices, air tourism to San Francisco and from San Francisco to destinations such as Hawaiâ€™i increased rapidly. SFO passenger traffic continued to increase dramatically through the 1960s. Airfield improvements provided four runways varying from 7,000 feet to 9,500 feet in length in anticipation of even larger aircraft being developed and spurred on by the economic success of the jet age.
