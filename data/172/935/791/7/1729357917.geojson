        "body": "Cats have charmed people with their mysterious allure for thousands of years. As adept hunters, many domestic cats are self-sufficient creatures with characteristically nonchalant, independent personalities. Cats were venerated by the ancient Egyptians and celebrated as symbols of good luck throughout Asia. In Europe, cats became associated with magic, witchcraft, and evil spirits and were persecuted for centuries before they gained cultural acceptance. Today, there are an estimated 600 million domesticated cats worldwide, making them the most popular contemporary pets. This exhibition explores the history of the cat and its allure through art, literature, and decorative arts from around the world. \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is now on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
