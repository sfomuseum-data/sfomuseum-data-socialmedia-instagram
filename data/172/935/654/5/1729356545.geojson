        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1927, Charles A. Lindbergh landed in Paris, France, after completing his historic, first solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1919, New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig, offered $25,000 to the first person to complete a non-stop transatlantic flight. On May 20, 1927, Lindbergh took off from New York in his \"Spirit of St. Louis\", a custom Ryan NYP (New York to Paris) single-engine aircraft. The 3,500-mile journey followed the circle route over the Canadian maritime provinces, then crossed more than 1,900 miles of open ocean. The next day, after thirty-three and a half hours, the 25-year-old pilot became an international star upon landing at Parisâ€™ Le Bourget Field. This shocking achievement changed the course of history and brought aviation to the forefront of public attention.  Image: Charles Lindbergh postcard, 1927. Gift of Frank A. Norick. 2011.128.006 ",
