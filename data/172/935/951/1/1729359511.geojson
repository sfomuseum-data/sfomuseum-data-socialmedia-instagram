        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1960, Delta Air Lines introduced the Convair CV-880 into service. The aircraft was claimed to be the fastest commercial jetliner in service at the time with a maximum speed of 615mph. Developed and produced by the Convair Division of General Dynamics in San Diego, California, the medium-to-long-range aircraft had a narrow body, sharply swept-back wings, and a capacity for up to one hundred passengers. Delta initially packaged its 880 flights as a premium service configured for seventy-two first-class passengers. Its first-class lounge was touted as the largest available in a jetliner.
