        "body": "Our exhibition about the history and design of the typewriter opens tomorrow! The typewriter is one of the great inventions of the modern world. A marvel of industrial engineering and ingenuity, it revolutionized communication and was an essential tool for countless writers. The ease and speed of communication on paper increased dramatically when typewriters became available in the late 1800s. Typewriting was efficient, created clear and legible documents, and easily produced multiple copies using carbon paper.  Learn more about the typewriter in our exhibition, \"The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing\" opening tomorrow, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Thetypewriter",
