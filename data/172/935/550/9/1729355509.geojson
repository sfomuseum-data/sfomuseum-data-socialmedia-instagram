        "body": "#Onthisday in 1965, the Douglas DC-9 took off on its maiden flight. The DC-9 was designed by Douglas as a mid-range jetliner with a smaller capacity than the Boeing 727 and with the capability of serving small regional airports. It featured two jet engines mounted at the rear of the fuselage and a high-mounted horizontal stabilizer. The aircraft was produced for 41 years, first by Douglas, then McDonnell Douglas, and finally Boeing in numerous variants and derivatives, with final deliveries of its last derivative, the Boeing 717, in 2006. Have you ever flown on a DC-9?  Image: SAS (Scandinavian Airlines System) postcard, Douglas DC-9, 1960s, Gift of the William Hough Collection. 2008.055.591",
