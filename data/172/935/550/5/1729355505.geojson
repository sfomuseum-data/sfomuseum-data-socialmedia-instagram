        "body": "United Air Lines received its first Boeing 747-100 on June 26, 1970, and a month later launched 747 service from San Francisco to Honolulu. The airline’s 747 featured a spacious first-class cabin at the front of the aircraft with a spiral staircase that led up to a first-class lounge, branded as the “Red Carpet Room” and furnished with captain’s chairs, wrap-around couches, and a back wall mural. First-class stewards and stewardesses offered special wine, fruit, and cheese services in the upper-deck lounge and wore unique uniforms featuring brightly colored plaid sports coats and skirts designed by Jean Louis. In response to growing concerns over gender equality in the workplace, United began to hire male stewards in 1970 for Hawai’i service only. In 1972, after four decades of employing primarily female cabin crews, the airline opened the steward position for all of its routes. “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
