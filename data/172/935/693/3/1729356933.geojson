        "body": "In her ongoing series, \"City Space\", Chicago-based artist Clarissa Bonet explores the urban landscape from a pedestrian perspective, producing dramatic images that draw focus both on the surface of the city and the psychological resonance of the architecture within it.  As part of her working process, Bonet roams the city, observing the idiosyncrasies of the urban environment and taking note of chance encounters and interactions between strangers and their surroundings. Bonet later restages these moments during ideal weather and lighting conditions to produce striking photographs that evoke the almost contradictory sensation of solitude one often feels amidst the towering buildings and anonymous crowds of the city. Transformed by the artistâ€™s use of deep shadow, striking light, and muted color, routine moments become elevated and hyper-real, offering an opportunity for us to reflect upon our own relationship with the urban environment.  See \"City Space\" by Clarissa Bonet on display, pre-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/2StQZlZ",
