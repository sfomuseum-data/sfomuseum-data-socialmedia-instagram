        "body": "The iconic flight bag. In the 1940s, airlines offered small bags for carry-on items emblazoned with their logos and services. Foreseeing a great potential market, manufacturers secured rights to produce airline branded bags in large numbers. By the late 1950s, the “flight bag” was featured in airline advertising and promotions. This new type of hand luggage, with its vivid graphics, became a chic and desirable status symbol that identified its user as a member of the new globe-trotting jet set. Which of these bags do you like best?  Image: Boeing advertisement, Sunset magazine, 1962. SFO Museum Collection. 2017.112.041",
