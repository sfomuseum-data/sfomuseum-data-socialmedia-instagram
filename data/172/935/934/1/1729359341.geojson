        "body": "Edna Bullock (1915–97) began her career as a photographer in 1976, shortly after the death of her husband, the celebrated photographer Wynn Bullock. She was sixty-one at the time, explaining, “I had inherited a darkroom, camera equipment, and supplies. For more than thirty years, I had been immersed in the world of photography. My own needs to be artistically creative were strong, so I decided to enroll in beginning photography at Monterey Peninsula College and see what I could do.” As if having learned the art of photography through osmosis, her talents quickly came to light.  See \"Flea Markets\" by Edna Bullock, on display, pre-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/2sSObkI",
