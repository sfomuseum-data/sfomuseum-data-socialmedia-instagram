The ultra low cost carrier traces its legacy back to the first Frontier Airlines, which was founded in 1950 and operated until 1986. In 1994, the new Frontier introduced a livery which included animals painted on the tail of every aircraft. Every animal also has a name, which is included in Frontier marketing and branding, a clever marketing approach. Passengers have reported to have favorite animals. Have you ever flown on Frontier?
