        "body": "In 1896, Franz Xaver Wagner (1837–1907) introduced a machine that provided the blueprint for modern typewriters used in offices throughout the world. Manufactured first as the Underwood No. 1, it featured a four-row keyboard with single-shift, and most importantly, an ingenious front-strike type-bar mechanism that wrote quickly and visibly with ease. For the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, Underwood produced a giant working typewriter, 1728 times the original size and weighing 14 tons or 28,000 pounds. It was advertised by the company as \"the machine you will eventually buy.\" Learn more about the typewriter in our exhibition, \"The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Thetypewriter",
