        "body": "In 1968, Braniff International turned over its advertising account from Wells, Rich, Greene to the upstart firm of Lois, Holland, Callaway. George Lois was a pioneer and proponent of \"big idea\" advertising that distilled the main selling point of a product down to a single compelling creative gesture, be it a slogan, logo, or campaign tag line. He married his brash, unapologetic Bronx attitude to Braniff International's renegade success in a single phrase that soon entered the general lexicon; \"When you got it- flaunt it.\" This campaign portrayed unexpected, of-the-moment celebrities who had \"it\" declaring their loyalty to Braniff International. The campaign ran in both print advertising and as television commercials. \"When You Got it- Flaunt It: #AdvertisingBraniff International\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/AdvertisingBraniff",
