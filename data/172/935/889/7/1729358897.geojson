        "body": "California was a West Coast center for the development of aviation from the earliest years of flight, and was home to numerous regional airlines. With the economic boom of the 1950s and 60s, the demand for economical, California-based commuter air service exceeded any previous era. As a result, a number of small, regional carriers were formed and operated within the state. One of these regional carriers, Cal-State Air Lines began operation in 1968. Though short lived, the company produced these eye-catching timetables. Cal State Air Lines operated a pair of Beech 99 Turboprops before going bankrupt in 1970. Do you remember Cal-State Air Lines?
