        "body": "The Curtiss Condor T-32 was the first land-based, luxury-sleeper-berth-equipped airliner to go into service, beginning in 1933 with American Airways (later American Airlines) and Eastern Air Transport (later Eastern Air Lines). The T-32 began with a request from the airlines for a larger, more advanced upgrade of the T-18 Condor airliner, which was developed from the Curtiss B-2 bomber. The result was a large capacity biplane with state-of-the-art advancements such as engine cowlings, a large, teardrop-shaped aerodynamic fuselage, and semi-retractable landing gear. The cabin could be configured for fifteen passengers for day use or six sleeper-berth cabins for longer distance overnight service. Americanâ€™s overnight coast-to-coast service between New York and Los Angeles was introduced in 1934. See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
