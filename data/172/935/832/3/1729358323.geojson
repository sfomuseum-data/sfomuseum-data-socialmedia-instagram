        "body": "The Lockheed Model 12 Electra was similar to the Model 10 Electra in design, but smaller and faster. Most airlines rejected the aircraft, primarily because of its low capacity of only six passengers. The few exceptions were Continental Air Lines, which operated a fleet of three Model 12 types, and British West Indian Airways. However, the aircraft was successful as a fast company and government transport, and as a military transport and bomber trainer.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models on display, pre-security in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
