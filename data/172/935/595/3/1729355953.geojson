The 772 pounds of airmail was carried by a Fokker F-VII a/3m tri-motor, call sign NC53. The flight took one hour and 10 minutes after the pilots encountered some heavy rain near Havana. The plane was christened “General Machado” after the Cuban President at the time. What are your favorite Pan Am memories?  Image: Pan American Airways, Fokker F-VII a/3m tri-motor, 1928.
