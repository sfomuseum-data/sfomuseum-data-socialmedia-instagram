        "body": "Do you recognize this sculpture? Peace by Beniamino Bufano was installed at SFO from 1958 to 1996. The stainless steel sculpture is a conically shaped Madonna with a glass tile mosaic inlay depicting the Universal Child. It was created for the 1939-40 San Francisco Golden Gate International Exposition but never installed. The sculpture was relocated when the International Terminal was built and moved to its present site on Brotherhood Way in southwest San Francisco. Do you remember seeing this sculpture at SFO?
