        "body": "The pedestal displayed here exhibits both veneering and marquetry. A veneer consists of a very fine sheet of wood applied to the surface of furniture. During the Victorian Era, mechanization made it easier to slice valuable woods into thin sheets. Typically, costlier woods such as mahogany or walnut were applied to inferior woods. Wood veneers were also selected for their interesting grain patterns. Marquetry entails cutting wood veneers, in various colors and grain patterns, into decorative designs and adhering them to a piece of furniture or decorative art object. Materials such as mother-of-pearl, ivory, tortoise shell, and fine metals might also be applied. Marquetry first reached a high level of sophistication in France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through the work of royal cabinet maker André-Charles Boulle (1642–1732). “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
