        "body": "Ernest Hemingway (1899–1961) was a master of American literature. Celebrated for his refined, vivid prose, Hemingway wrote with passion and from experience. He published \"A Farewell to Arms\" after he sustained severe wounds in Italy serving with the American Red Cross during the First World War. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" followed his assignment as a Spanish Civil War journalist. Hemingway’s great interest in bullfighting reenergized the sport after Death in the Afternoon, and his equally famous love of fishing inspired \"The Old Man and the Sea\". While living outside of Havana, Cuba, with his wife Mary at Finca Vigia, their “Lookout Farm,” Hemingway was awarded a Pulitzer Prize and Nobel Prize in literature.  See Ernest Hemingway's #typewriter on display in our exhibition, \"The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing\" post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Thetypewriter",
