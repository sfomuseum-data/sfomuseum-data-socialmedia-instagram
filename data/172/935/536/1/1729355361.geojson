Established in 1870, the park required meticulous planning and diligent planting by Park Superintendent John McClaren as the north west side of San Francisco was mostly sand dunes. This circa 1920 photograph of Golden Gate Park and San Francisco by 20th century aviator and engineer, Stanley H. Page, shows the park along side the undeveloped sand dunes of what would become the Sunset.  See more 1920s photos of the Bay Area in \"Above the Bay: The Aerial Photography of Stanley Page\" online at: http://bit.ly/StanleyHenryPage",
