        "body": "As the twentieth century neared, the balloon had been in existence for over a hundred years and, except for a small number of newly introduced airships and gliders, was the most prevalent form of aviation up to that time. The first viable airplane would not be introduced to the public until 1908 (due primarily to the secrecy of the Wright brothers following their first successful flight in 1903). Hence, aeronauts continued to look for new uses for the balloon over the next decade. This 1910 photo from Oakland, CA, shows a balloon ascension with onlookers.  Our exhibition on the history of ballooning, \"Into the Ether: Published Works on Ballooning and Atmospheric Studies, 1783â€“1910\" is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/IntoTheEther  Image: Oakland, California, balloon ascension, 1910.
