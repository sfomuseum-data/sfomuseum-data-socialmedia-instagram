        "body": "By the 17th century, many Japanese people kept cats as pets, and felines frequently appeared on decorated ceramics. Traditional ceramic manufacturing towns in Japan include Kutani, located in Ishikawa Prefecture. The Kutani kilns were established in the late 1600s, and then closed for more than a century before production was revived in the 1820s. Kutani ware remained obscure in the West until pieces were shown at the Paris Exhibition of 1867, where the porcelain was admired for its beauty and durability. In addition to dinnerware, Kutani artisans crafted sculpture for the export market, where the cat was a favorite subject.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
