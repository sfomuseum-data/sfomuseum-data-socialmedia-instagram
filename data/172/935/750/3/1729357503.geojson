        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1974, the Concorde landed at SFO. This brief visit was part of a promotional tour to airports around the world. The Concorde was a supersonic transport aircraft that flew primarily commercial transatlantic flights. British Airways and Air France both operated steady commercial service with the Concorde. The inaugural Air France flight from Paris to Washington, DC on May 24, 1976, took 3 hours and 50 minutes and cost about $8,000 in today's currency. Comparatively, a direct flight from Washington to Paris took at least 7 hours. The Concorde was in service between 1976 and 2003. Did you ever fly on a Concorde?
