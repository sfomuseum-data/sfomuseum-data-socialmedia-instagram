        "body": "The Flying Tiger Line was founded on June 24, 1945, as the National Skyway Freight Corporation. In 1947, the airline changed its name to The Flying Tiger Line, a reference to the pilots who operated in the Far East theatre of WWII and were called 'Flying Tigers.â€™ One of the first scheduled cargo operators in the United States, the airline was awarded a certificate from the C.A.B (Civil Aeronautics Board) in 1949. Although primarily a cargo airline, the Flying Tiger Line also offered passenger services. It was absorbed into Federal Express (now known as FedEx) in 1989. Do you remember the Flying Tiger Line?
