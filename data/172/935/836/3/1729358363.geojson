        "body": "Introduced in the late 1930s, the British produced Short S.30 series of aircraft was a large-capacity double-deck flying boat. Of the nine built, four were equipped with in-flight refueling capability and extra fuel tanks enabling them to perform regular transatlantic airmail service. In 1939, an S.30 inaugurated Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) service, from Auckland to Sydney. Weekly service was later expanded to three flights every two weeks with connections to San Francisco on Pan American Airways flying boats operating out of Auckland.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display pre-security in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
