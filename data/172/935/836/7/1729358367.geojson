        "body": "During the mid-1970s, Hugh Holland spent three years photographing the early days of skateboarding. Shooting with repackaged color negative movie film, he documented the scene in a warm palette and with a unique approach. Unlike the work of many skate photographers at that time, Holland's photographs often depart from the common wide-angle action shot-he was interested in capturing the atmosphere and idiosyncrasies of what was fast becoming a cultural phenomenon. While many of his images feature skaters airborne or mid-carve, he gave equal attention to the subtleties of the culture-the daily lives, fashion, and comradery of the skaters. Over forty years later, his images continue to evoke the energy and excitement of the golden age of skateboarding.  See \"Locals Only\" by Hugh Holland on display, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2prnrWH",
