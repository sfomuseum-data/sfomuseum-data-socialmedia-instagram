        "body": "#Onthisday in 1988, the last branded PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines) flight departed San Diego and landed in Las Vegas as a USAir flight. What is your favorite PSA memory?  In 1949, Kenny Friedkin, a flight trainer and test pilot, formed Pacific Southwest Airlines or PSA. Based out of San Diego's Lindbergh Field, where Friedkin previously ran a flight school, the airline began weekly round-trip flights between San Diego and Oakland with a single leased Douglas DC-3. By the end of the decade, the airline offered nearly one hundred flights a week to numerous destinations throughout the state. By offering discounted fares, easy check-ins, and friendly, on-time service, the airline quickly attracted a sizable, loyal customer base, which included businessmen, tourists, and sailors from San Diego. However, by the mid-1980s, overexpansion and excessive debt left PSA vulnerable to a takeover, and in 1986, after nearly four decades of operation in California, the airline was acquired by USAir.
