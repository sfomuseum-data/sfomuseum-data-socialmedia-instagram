Generating a set of scenic wallpaper entailed a scrupulous amount of planning, design, and production. It requires anywhere from over one hundred to several thousand printing blocks to create a scenic paper set.  Zuber et Cie are still producing scenic wallpaper today, with and over 150,000 woodblocks are stored in the factory’s historic cellars. Our exhibition, “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper,” opens soon in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
