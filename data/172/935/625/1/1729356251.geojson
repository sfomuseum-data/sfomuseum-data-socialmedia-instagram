        "body": "In the United States, Neo-Grec furniture coincided with Egyptian and Renaissance revival styles popular in the second half of the nineteenth century. This eclectic style took inspiration from classical Greek, Roman, and Egyptian motifs, often fusing styles together. For instance, decorative motifs might include both Egyptian lotus blossoms and Greek fretwork. Archaeological excavations made at Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Giza in the nineteenth century fostered interest in these ancient cultures.  The simple design of this pedestal appears lavish because of its polychromatic-painted elements with gilded accents on an ebonized ground. The pedestal’s strong vertical lines encourage the viewer to draw their eye upwards towards the art object the pedestal was intended to display. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
