The TriStar trijet was the last commercial passenger airliner produced by the Lockheed Corporation. An advanced feature of the L-1011 was the autoland system which automated the landing procedure in unfavorable weather conditions. Only 250 L-1011 TriStar jets were produced, and production halted in 1982. Did you ever fly on a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar? “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
