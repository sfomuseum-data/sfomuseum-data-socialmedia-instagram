        "body": "Based in Croydon Airport in South London, Imperial Airways was established as a merger between four different British companies in 1924. In order to compete with government-subsidized continental air carriers, the British government encouraged the Imperial Airways merger to simplify their own subsidizing efforts.  Imperial Airways was short lived, only operating from 1924 until 1939, when the company merged with British Airways Ltd. to form BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation). BOAC continued to operate until 1974, when it was merged with BEA (British European Airways) to form British Airways, the current flag carrier of the United Kingdom. British Airways was also coincidentally founded #onthisday in 1974. Do you remember Imperial Airways?  Image: Imperial Airways route map, Africa, c. 1940.  Gift of Jon E. Krupnick. 2008.056.0710",
