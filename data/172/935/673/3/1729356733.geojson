        "body": "Mid-century radios were available in a variety of bold shapes and angular designs. As new technologies allowed for increasingly compact and affordable sets, radios were advertised for every room of the house. For the first time, radios made their way into bedrooms and morning routines with the introduction of combination alarm clock sets. By the end of the decade, tiny, electrical transistors started to replace vacuum tubes, and radios became even more portable. Some radios even pioneered alternative power sources, such as the solar- and battery-powered Hoffman Trans-Solar hybrid-portable. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer",
