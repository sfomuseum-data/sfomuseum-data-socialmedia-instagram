From cups to sculptures, to bowls and candelabrums, this exhibition, not only showcases different techniques in silversmithing but also different objects made from silver.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
