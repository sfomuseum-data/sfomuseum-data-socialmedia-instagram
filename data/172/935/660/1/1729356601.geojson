        "body": "What’s going on at the museum? We’re preparing for our newest exhibition, “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” by creating custom mounts for every object. This piece will be held in place by small pins set next to the pedestal’s feet and into the case floor. First, brass rods are measured and cut to the appropriate dimensions for a particular object. Then they’re covered with a plastic sleeve to protect the object from the hardness of the metal. All of the mounts created by our staff are lovingly crafted and tested before being installed for exhibition.  Stay tuned for more behind the scenes updates from the museum! ",
