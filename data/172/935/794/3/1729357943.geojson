        "body": "The Convair 240 was the first postwar commercial airliner developed by the Consolidated Vultee Company, or Convair, of San Diego. It was designed to be a pressurized, mid-range DC-3 replacement that was easy to service and turnover between flights. It featured a built-in, drop-down stairway for quick passenger loading, petal-style engine cowlings for rapid maintenance, and tricycle-configuration landing gear. It could carry forty passengers comfortably and had a range of up to 1,200 miles.  First flown in 1947, it was introduced by American Airlines in 1948. 176 were produced for numerous airlines worldwide, including Pan American World Airways, which operated a fleet of twenty of the type.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
