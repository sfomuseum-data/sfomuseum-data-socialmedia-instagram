        "body": "Peter Voulkos (1924–2002) was at the leading edge of a revolution in American ceramics. In 1954, Voulkos was hired to form a ceramics department at the Otis Art Institute (now Otis College of Art and Design) in Los Angeles, where he employed traditional techniques and experimented with more abstract forms. By the end of the decade, Voulkos relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area to teach at the University of California, Berkeley. As his focus shifted from refined ceramic vessels to thick-walled works, Voulkos blurred the lines between fine art and craft with innovative, deconstructed forms and striking, expressionist clay sculpture. Subsequently, generations of Voulkos’ students have made their own impact on studio ceramics and clay sculpture.  See \"California Studio Craft: Featuring Works from the Forrest L. Merrill Collection\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/CaliforniaCrafts",
