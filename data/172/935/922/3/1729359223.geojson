We wandered out upon the Appian Way, and then went on, through miles of ruined tombs and broken walls…past the tomb of Cecilia Metella…the most picturesque and beautiful clusters of arches; broken temples; broken tombs. A desert of decay, somber and desolate beyond all expression; and with a history in every stone that strews the ground.” Charles Dickens, Pictures from Italy (1846)  See \"All Roads Lead to #Rome: 17th–19th Century Architectural Souvenirs from the Collection of #Piraneseum\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AllRoadsRome",
