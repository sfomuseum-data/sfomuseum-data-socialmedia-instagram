To entice passengers to fly the route, the airline produced this first-person account of a day in Rome by following two TWA employees, Henry Riegner and Dick Roney, on February 10, 1948. Among their documented escapades was a visit to the Sistine Chapel and attending a church service presided by Pope Pius XII.  Image: TWA (Trans World Airlines) brochure, Rome,1948. Gift of Thomas G.
