        "body": "Located in Oakland, Peralta Elementary School is a public school where art enhances every aspect of student learning. The schoolâ€™s leadership recognizes that art education is a vital element in the quest to acquire skills, knowledge, and appreciation for our rich and diverse world. [Art provides students with a positive association with learning, and empowers them to meet both educational and personal challenges with creativity, flexibility, confidence, and hope.] Through the arts, Peralta students are able to experience opportunities that make meaningful and lasting influences on their community. The works featured in this exhibition were produced by student artists from the third grade. Guided by artist-in-residence Ellen Oppenheimer, students created a range of colorful interlocking origami modules that highlight the talent and craftsmanship of young artists at Peralta Elementary School. @peraltaelementary  See \"Modular Origami\" by students from Peralta Elementary School, on display, pre-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2UPmRzc",
