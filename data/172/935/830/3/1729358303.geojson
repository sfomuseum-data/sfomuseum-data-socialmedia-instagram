        "body": "The Boeing 727 is a medium range, intermediate-capacity jetliner that features a clean swept wing, a high horizontal stabilizer, and a unique tri-jet configuration. The only tri-jet to be developed by Boeing, the design dictated that the horizontal stabilizer be placed well away from the middle engine, high on top of the vertical stabilizer. Braniff International Airways purchased a 727 fleet and, with advertising executive Mary Wells' radical revamping of the corporate identity in the 1960s, painted the aircraft in a variety of solid, brightly colored liveries. Have you ever flown on a Braniff 727? \"When You Got it- Flaunt It: #AdvertisingBraniff International\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/AdvertisingBraniff",
