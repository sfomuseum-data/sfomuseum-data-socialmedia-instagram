        "body": "For around two hundred years, Western women have traditionally worn white or ivory on their wedding day. In 1840, Queen Victoria of Britain married Prince Albert in a white wedding dress wearing a veil and carrying an orange blossom wreath. The event was highly publicized in newspapers and periodicals of the day. As a result, women from all levels of society aspired to wear white with accompanying veil and bouquet on their wedding day.  For a short period in the 1920s, metallic lamés and lace, pale gold, and shell pink fabrics became fashionable bridal attire. The classic white wedding dress returned to favor during the 1930s and its preeminence continues to this day. Matching shoes have long been an important part of a woman’s wedding ensemble.
