        "body": "Typewriter design during the late nineteenth century was far from standardized and innovative ideas abounded. The Oliver typewriter is one of the iconic designs of this early industrial period. A lateral-down-strike machine patented in 1894, its type-bars, mounted under brightly plated covers high and to the sides, swung down against the paper to print.
