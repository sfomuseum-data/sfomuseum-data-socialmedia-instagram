        "body": "In 1971, TWA (Trans World Airlines) introduced a new group of flight attendant uniforms conceived by Rome-based fashion designer Valentino Garavani. The uniform came in three colors: purple, brown, or beige. It featured a range of wardrobe combinations in a polyester knit fabric, including a form-fitting minidress, pants, and a frock coat. The outfits came with signature Valentino buttons and matching scarves, and could be worn with pumps or go-go boots. In promotions, flight attendants were featured wearing various colors and combinations of the uniform. This promotional image shows a flight attendant wearing the beige frock coat over the minidress. “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
