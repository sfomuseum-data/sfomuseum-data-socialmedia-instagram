        "body": "TV lamps were designed to preserve one’s eyesight while watching television in the dark. While this idea may sound strange today, the picture quality of early sets was somewhat dim, causing people to watch programming in darkened rooms to improve the viewing experience. Fears surfaced concerning the potential for eyesight damage, and some even believed that prolonged exposure could cause blindness. TV lamps flooded the shelves of department and dime stores. Commonly produced as back-lighted figural forms, these kitschy, ceramic lamps were proudly displayed atop televisions and provided an eerie, dim glow that allowed for hours of guilt-free television viewing. Manufacturers created thousands of designs in the form of panthers, geese, fish, cats, and other animals and shapes. \"The Modern Consumer: Products and Style\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/1950sConsumer . . .",
