Place the fingers lightly but firmly, without pressure, upon the table so as to allow it to move easily and freely. In from one to five minutes the tablet will commence to move, at first slowly, then faster, and then be able to talk or answer questions, which it will do rapidly by touching the printed words or the letters necessary to form words and sentences with the foreleg or pointer.” \"The Mysterious Talking Board: #OuijaAndBeyond\", is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/OuijaAndBeyond #Ouija #OuijaBoard  G O O D B Y E",
