A decade after he returned to the West Coast, Macchiarini switched gears and in 1938 began a career in the metal arts, self-taught through books on jewelry making and Bauhaus design. Macchiarini was an active community organizer and co-founder of the Metal Arts Guild and San Francisco Art Festivals, and his studio in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood was a hub of creativity and discussion for mid-century artists.",
