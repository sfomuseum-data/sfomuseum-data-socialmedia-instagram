        "body": "In 1782, Congress designated the bald eagle, unique to North America, as the national emblem. This imposing creature takes form in a variety of folk art, including wood carvings. In southeastern Pennsylvania, where wood was especially abundant, Wilhelm Schimmel (1817–90), a German immigrant who came to the United States in the 1860s, became the most famous—or perhaps infamous—carver in Cumberland County. Schimmel is particularly noted for his carved, painted eagles. In this large, outspread example, he carved the wings separately before dovetailing them to the creatures’ bodies.  Carved Wooden Eagle is courtesy of the collection of the Landis Valley Village and Farm Museum, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
