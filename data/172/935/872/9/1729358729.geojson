The third, built in 1912, still stands today. This aerial photo taken around 1922 by mechanical engineer and early aviator, Stanley Page, shows the structures in place on the island at the time. In 1934, the island was transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and remained a prison until 1963.  Image: San Francisco Bay Area aerial photograph, Alcatraz, c. 1922.
