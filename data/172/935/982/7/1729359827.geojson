        "body": "The Turquoise Coast, in southwest Turkey, was home to the Ancient Lycians. Because Lycians lived between the Greek, Roman, and Near Eastern worlds, they intermingled with and absorbed elements from each of these cultures. Homerâ€™s Iliad mentions the Lycians as allies of the Trojans. The Lycians left behind some truly extraordinary funerary architecture in the form of carved stone tombs and sarcophagi. Sarcophagi probably served as the predominant method of burial in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. These tombs attracted great attention after Westerners began documenting them in the early nineteenth century. Examples of their sarcophagi can be found on the plates and soup tureen displayed here. Sarcophagi consist of a base, a burial chamber, and an arched lid. The funerary art the Lycians left behind still remains in Lycia and is akin to an open-air museum today.  All objects and images are from the collection of Michael Sack. \"From #PrintToPlate: Views of the East on Transferware\" is on display, every day, 24 hours a day, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/PrintToPlate",
