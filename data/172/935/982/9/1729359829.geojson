        "body": "“The way of life in California is not like a life in Chicago…it’s outdoor-indoor living, and I wanted to do something that was as nice to use and as beautiful for everyday use as it was for Sunday’s best.” – Edith Heath  Influenced by organic design and refined modernism, Edith Heath (1911–2005) translated the studio pottery aesthetics of her early hand-thrown work into small-batch production methods for storage vessels and tableware. With manufacturing equipment designed by her husband Brian Heath (1913–2001), the Heaths made simple and elegant housewares at their factory in Sausalito, California, for over fifty years.  All objects are from the collection of Steve Cabella.
