        "body": "Boeing’s district manager Steve Stimpson conceived of this all-season uniform for the world’s first airline stewardess, registered nurse Ellen Church, who was hired in San Francisco. Made of wool and worn from 1930 to 1932, it combines the cape and “shower cap” tam of military nurse attire and a classic suit with double-breasted jacket and pleated, calf-length skirt. Contrasting accents on the jacket sleeve lend an air of authority. The dark green and gray color scheme coordinated with the highlights of the Boeing Model 80A aircraft livery.
