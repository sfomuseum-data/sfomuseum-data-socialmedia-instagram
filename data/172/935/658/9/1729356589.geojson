Braniff, to invest in an aviation company they named Tulsa-Oklahoma City Airline. They formed a new company in 1930 and named it Braniff Airways. With a Chicagoâ€“Dallas airmail contract awarded in 1934, they soon added service to the Mexican border. After World War II, Braniff flew internationally to the Caribbean, Mexico, and other parts of Latin America, and began doing business as Braniff International Airways.
