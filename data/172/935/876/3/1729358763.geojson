        "body": "For more than ninety years, United Airlines personnel have filled the dozens of positions needed to sustain the operations of a global organization. Pilots are outfitted with military style, two-piece suit uniforms and hats. Cuff ranks can designate captains, first officers, and other members of the flight crew. The hat badges and the wings worn on the jacket and shirt complete the outfit. Over the decades, insignia styles have evolved as aircraft and service modernized. The color and finish of Unitedâ€™s hat badges and wings have also changed over the years, but these insignia sets have always retained their classic aeronautical bearings.
