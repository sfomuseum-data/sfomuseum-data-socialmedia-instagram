        "body": "In the 1890s, the cost of a new, full-size typewriter was more than the average American earned in one month. Index typewriters were a simpler and more affordable alternative. Available at a fraction of the price and manufactured in a variety of designs, they were the earliest portable writing machines. The innovative wheel-index Victor typewriter printed from type attached to the ends of strips arranged in a daisy-wheel pattern, much like the IBM Wheelwriter a century later.  Learn more about typewriters in our exhibition, \"The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing\", post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Thetypewriter",
