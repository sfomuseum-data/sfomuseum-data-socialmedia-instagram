        "body": "Every winter, hundreds of thousands of starlings migrate from northern Europe to the countryside near Rome in search of a warmer climate. As dusk falls, the birds take flight in dense cloud-like formations known as murmurations. In his series, \"Murmur\", artist Richard Barnes photographs European starlings as they coalesce into dark amorphous shapes that dance above Rome. Made over the course of two years, Barnesâ€™ photographs evoke a sense of mystery in the seemingly choreographed movements of the migrating birds, whose humbling aerial displays remind us that many aspects of nature remain just outside the realm of human understanding. \"Murmur\" by Richard Barnes on display, pre-security, in Terminal 3. https://www.flysfo.com/museum/exhibitions/richard-barnes-murmur",
