        "body": "Over time, the traditional Cajun waltzes and two-steps played on the accordion fused with rhythm-and-blues, blues, and eventually, rock-and-roll to create a uniquely new Creole sound called zydeco. Clifton Chenier (1925–87), considered the “King of Zydeco,” invented and popularized the musical genre to audiences nationwide as well as in Europe. Chenier’s father, a farmer, played music on the accordion at Creole dances. Rather than use the traditional button accordion typical in Cajun and Creole music, Chenier played a piano accordion, which can play in any key. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
