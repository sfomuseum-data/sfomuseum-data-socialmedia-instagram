        "body": "Our newest exhibition is now on view! “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” presents a selection of arguably the most spectacular nineteenth-century French scenic wallpapers. These mural-like papers transformed rooms, providing the opportunity for viewers to be swept away to an exotic place or immersed in an exciting period in history. “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” is on view pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall. Very special thanks to Zuber et Cie, Brian D. Coleman, and John Nalewaja and Jim Francis of Scenic Wallpaper Installations. ",
