This circa 1959 Pan American wool suit in Tunis Blue created a fresh look with sharp, angular features exclaiming the aerodynamic mood of the exciting new jet age. The fitted jacket’s hourglass shape was emphasized by the slant of the triangular faux pocket flap, swept-back cuff, and partial peaked collar boldly traced by the blouse. A matching pencil skirt with a deep kick pleat completed the silhouette, while the hat’s forward fin and white piping punctuated the statement. Do you remember this uniform?
