        "body": "Glass-globe vending machines are some of the most iconic coin-operated devices. Candy-coated gumballs were introduced in the 1900s, dispensed in machines with glass globes of different shapes and sizes mounted atop ornate, cast-iron bodies or simple, stamped-steel bases. By the mid-1920s, the gumball was the most numerous, coin-vended confection sold in the United States.  All objects are courtesy of Joe Welch American Antique Museum in San Bruno, California. \"The Automatic Age: #CoinOperated Machines\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/CoinOperated",
