He taught himself how to photograph, met Ansel Adams, and built a makeshift darkroom in an unused utility closet. Since then, he has been committed to using the camera to explore, to question, and to notice. His photographic projects aim to translate the wordless feeling of deep connection to the natural world into images that communicate that same sense to the viewer.",
