In 2012, we presented “Threading the Needle: Sewing in the Machine Age” which featured the development of the domestic sewing machine from the 1850s to the 1970s. Celebrating over one hundred years of sewing, the exhibition also featured pattern illustrations, sewing boxes, sewing birds, needle cases, chatelaines, and pincushions. Do you remember this exhibition?  “Threading the Needle: Sewing in the Machine Age” is online at: https://bit.ly/3fr7xmk",
