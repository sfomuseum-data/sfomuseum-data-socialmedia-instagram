Hired by BAT at its San Francisco office, she pioneered the “stewardess” profession by selecting seven more women for hire. During the 1930s, stewardesses hired by airlines were required to be trained nurses and unmarried. Their jobs included weighing passengers and luggage, loading and unloading bags, helping to fuel airplanes, and occasionally pushing the airplane into hangars.
