        "body": "Think back to a time when families would gather around the radio to hear the news, weather, and their favorite radio programs. Radios gained a place of prominence in the home and office during the 1930s. No longer regarded simply as functional items, radios.These artfully designed, wood-case sets were the flagships of tabletop radios and paired contrasting grill cloths with bright metals and lacquered woods. Many radios featured modern typefaces and stylized tuning indicators, such as the Wilcox-Gay A-15, with its multicolored, skyscraper-inspired dial.  Radio courtesy of the collection of California Historical Radio Society. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
