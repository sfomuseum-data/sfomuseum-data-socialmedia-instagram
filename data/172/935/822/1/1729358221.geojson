        "body": "Airlines such as Pan American World Airways offered small bags for carry-on items emblazoned with their logos and services. Luggage manufacturers also responded with lines of small travel bags and cases. These were sold through mail-order catalogs and at airport stores and sometimes given out to passengers and as promotional items at travel agencies. This new type of hand luggage with its vivid graphics, became a chic and desirable status symbol that identified its user as a member of the new globe-trotting jet set. Do you own any flight bags?
