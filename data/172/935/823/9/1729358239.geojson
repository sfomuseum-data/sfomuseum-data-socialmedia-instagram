        "body": "The word “home” evokes a variety of images and emotions for different people. To some, it may conjure thoughts of where we begin or end our day—an actual place or a state of mind. To others, it may be a feeling or sensation, either well-known or sought after. Home can be a place of solitude and introspection, or one of engagement with family and community. The group exhibition in this gallery features artists whose photographs explore notions of home and the many forms it can take. \"Photo Alliance: Home\" was produced in collaboration with Photo Alliance, a non-profit organization. This year, the organization invited artists from across the country to share images that interpret the idea of home. Image selections were made from over twelve hundred individual submissions by a jury including Tina Barney, a renowned portrait photographer based in New York; Christopher McCall, director of Pier 24 Photography in San Francisco; and Thea Traff, Associate Photo Editor at The New Yorker.  Contributing artists include: Contributing artists include: Sarah Christianson (b. 1982), Amanda Boe (b. 1978), and Abelardo Morell (b. 1948).
