        "body": "Formed in 1947, California Central Airlines (CCA) was a short-lived, post-war airline based in Burbank, California. in 1949, the airline began operating intra state fights along the California corridor under the jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC), not the Federally-administered Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). This gave the airline more freedom to establish its own routes and fares, as long as it operated within the borders of California. In 1949, a one-way fare from Oakland to Burbank was only $9.99, which was just a little more than a train ticket on the Southern Pacific ($7.50) and half the price of a ticket on Western Airlines ($20). Perhaps unsurprisingly, these fares were not economically viable, and the airline declared bankruptcy in 1954.  Image: California Central Airlines, Martin 202, 1951. William T. Larkins.
