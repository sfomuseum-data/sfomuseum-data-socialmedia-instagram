        "body": "First flown in 1957, the Boeing Model 707 was the first US-made, pure-turbojet airliner to be introduced. It effectively ushered in the jet age. In November 1959, TWA (Trans World Airlines) launched 707 transatlantic service direct from New York to London and then to Frankfurt. By the early 1960s, the airline was operating the 707 on the transpolar route from Los Angeles to Paris. By 1969, TWA 707s were also flying transpacific routes to Asia. Designated \"Star Stream\" by TWA, the 707 proved to be a fast, reliable, intercontinental and transcontinental workhorse and was operated by the airline until the early 1980s.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
