The effect is weird and mysterious as your destiny is flashed before you.” Mystifying Oracle Ouija Electric advertisement 1933  The William Fuld Manufacturing Company produced a number of interesting boards, perhaps none more so than the exceedingly rare Mystifying Oracle Electric, which they offered in the 1930s. The oversized board and planchette are made of sheet metal and finished in a faux mahogany. The board displays an unusual, scattered alphabet layout with a Grecian-inspired border pattern. Its most unusual feature, however, is a remarkable light-up planchette, powered by a dry-cell battery. An electric bulb cleverly illuminates letters through the viewing window when the electric switch, located on the underside of the #planchette, comes into contact with bumps on the board.  All objects are courtesy of Gene Orlando, Museum of Talking Boards, and Robert Murch, The Talking Board Historical Society.
