Your “guests” will include a wide variety of interesting people, possibly a business man from Bombay, a military family moving from New York to Seattle, even your next-door-neighbor.  Visiting with passengers aloft, you will soon realize your position as a stewardess offers new opportunities to increase your knowledge of the world. As you say goodbye to your passengers when they reach their destinations, you will have a deep feeling of satisfaction and pride in your career as a stewardess.\" Image:  United Air Lines employee pamphlet, stewardess, 1957.
