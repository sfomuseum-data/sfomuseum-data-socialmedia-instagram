        "body": "\"I wanted to photograph the festival in the way that I saw cinema.\" Pamela Gentile  In conjunction with the 60th anniversary of the San Francisco International Film Festival (SFIFF), SFO Museum presents San Francisco Film Society official photographer Pamela Gentile's \"Atmosphere: Portrait of a Film Festival\", a collection of Gentile's evocative images from the past thirty years of the SFIFF. As a former film studies major, Gentile brings an insiderâ€™s eye to her ongoing documentation of the SFIFF. Her close relationship with the subject and passion for the cinema reveals itself in photographs that embrace an aesthetic informed by the industry itself.  See \"Atmosphere: Portrait of a Film Festival\" by #PamelaGentile, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/2nBCfyE ",
