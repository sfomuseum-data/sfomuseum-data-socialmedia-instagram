        "body": "In 1946, the Civil Aeronautics Board granted United Air Lines the transpacific route to Hawai'i, and in 1947, the airline inaugurated passenger service. Hawai’i became an affordable destination to a much broader segment of Americans. In an effort to promote and celebrate the traditions of the Islands, the Hawaiian Junior Chamber of Commerce organized Aloha Week with United’s sponsorship. By the 1950s, United was offering a broad schedule of flights on its spacious twin-deck Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, as well as all-inclusive vacation packages. Tourism to Hawai’i quickly grew to record levels.  During the 1960s, United flew Douglas DC-8 Mainliners to Hawai'i and introduced drink menu selections from the renowned tiki-themed restaurant, Trader Vic’s. One of the first of many Polynesian-style tiki bars to rise to popularity, Trader Vic’s was established in the 1930s by Victor Bergeron in Emeryville, California. Tiki statues and other Hawaiian and Polynesian themes appeared on many of United's inflight service items and promotions for the Islands.
