        "body": "Autonomous craft organizations provide artisans with a market for their goods and offer strength in numbers to their collective membership. In Chiapas, the more progressive weaving cooperatives also promote solidarity by creating a space for members of different communities to socialize and discuss current problems and issues. In 1996, the founding members of Jolom Mayaetik fought to form their new cooperative for pressing reasons, including declining wages, rising costs of living, and mismanagement of government-run cooperatives they previously worked for. Frustrated with exclusion from local government and marginal political representation outside of their communities, Jolom weavers also sought sociopolitical empowerment. Today, Jolom Mayaetik holds educational courses, lobbies for political inclusion, and lectures locally and internationally to promote the rights of women and indigenous people in Mexico.
