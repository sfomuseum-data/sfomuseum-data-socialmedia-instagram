        "body": "At the intersection of art and aviation: In the mid-1970s, the advertising firm of Dillon, Gordon, Hawkey \u0026 Shortt was hired to refresh Braniff International's brand image. The association of the Braniff brand with colorful aircraft, now updated to an attractive two-tone scheme, provided the basis for the agency's Flying Colors campaign. Gordon negotiated with the world-renowned artist Alexander Calder to paint an entire Douglas DC-8-62, transforming it into a flying work of art. This aircraft, named Flying Colors of South America, entered service in 1973 on routes between the U.S. and premier South American destinations. Calder then commemorated the United States Bicentennial in 1976 with another aircraft, this time a Boeing 727, named the Flying Colors of the United States. \"When You Got it- Flaunt It: #AdvertisingBraniff International\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/AdvertisingBraniff",
