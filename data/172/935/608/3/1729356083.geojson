        "body": "When introduced in 1949 by Pan American World Airways, the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser was considered the most luxurious airliner aloft. Its unique, pressurized, “double-bubble” fuselage was equipped with two decks; the upper contained a roomy main cabin, while the lower featured the highly popular cocktail lounge. The Stratocruiser was able to cruise near the stratosphere at over 300 miles per hour. With a range of just over 4,000 miles, the airliner was well suited for transoceanic routes. Pan American World Airways launched Stratocruiser transpacific service from San Francisco to Hawai’i in April 1949, and transatlantic service to London in June 1949 as all first-class “President” service.
