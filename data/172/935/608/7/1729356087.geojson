        "body": "Before the advent of photography, a number of superbly illustrated books made in the early nineteenth century helped fuel the public’s fascination with foreign locales. Englishmen Thomas and William Daniell published “Oriental Scenery” (London, 1795–1807) over several years. Their prints depicted the stunning landscapes and historic architecture of India and introduced viewers to the sites and scenes of distant lands they could only dream of experiencing in person. French wallpaper manufacturers drew freely from these publications to create panoramic papers but rarely copied scenes faithfully; instead, they adapted imagery—adding, removing, and even reversing sections of prints. Elements from several prints were often combined into one design. “Zuber: The Art of French Scenic Wallpaper” is on display, pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/ZuberScenicWallpaper",
