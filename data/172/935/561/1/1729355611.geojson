Hawaiian Airlines’ logo has changed multiple times over the last 90 years. In 1973, the airline introduced Pualani (Flower of the Sky), designed by Landor Associates, the famed design firm founded by Walter Landor and his wife Josephine. One of the first females depicted on the tail of a commercial airliner, she continues to represent the airlines’ brand identity. Have you ever flown on Hawaiian Airlines?
