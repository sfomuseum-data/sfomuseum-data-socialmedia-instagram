In 1969, it was acquired by expanding Aero Commuter, based out of Long Beach, which renamed itself Golden West Airlines and offered service to over twenty California cities. By the mid-1970s, Golden West was carrying the second largest volume of passenger traffic of commuter airlines in the U.S. The airline operated until 1983. Did you ever fly on Golden West Airlines?
