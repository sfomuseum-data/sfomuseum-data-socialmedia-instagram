Flanked by flags of the world and the 42nd U.S. Army Division Band performing the Star Spangled Banner, 111 passengers (40 first class and 71 coach) boarded the jetliner, named “Clipper America,” bound for Le Bourget Airport, Paris. The Boeing 707, was the first viable commercial jetliner to enter service and effectively launched a new era in commercial air travel, the Jet Age. Have you ever flown on a Boeing 707?
