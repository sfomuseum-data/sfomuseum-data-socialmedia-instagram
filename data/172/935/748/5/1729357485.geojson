        "body": "\"25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy\" by Andy Warhol (1928–87) is an artistic departure from the pop-art style that made him famous. Completed in the early 1950s, it is a book of brightly-colored, sentimental sketches representing eighteen of the twenty-five pet cats that eventually resided with Warhol in his apartment on New York’s Upper East Side. His first feline was a Siamese kitten named Hester, given to him by actress Gloria Swanson (1899–1983). Feeling that Hester was becoming lonely, Warhol brought home another cat and named him Sam. The cats had numerous litters over the next few years, and Warhol named each kitten after their father, Sam. \"25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy\" was released in a limited edition initially intended for friends and clients.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
