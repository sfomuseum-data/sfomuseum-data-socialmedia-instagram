        "body": "The last Continental Airlines flight departed #onthisday in 2012. Leaving Phoenix, AZ, as Continental flight 1267, it landed as United Airlines flight 1267 in Cleveland, OH. Continental Airlines began as Varney Speed Lines in 1934 and claimed to be the “Fastest Airline In The World.” The airline changed its name to Continental Air Lines in 1937. In 1968, it launched a new corporate identity that included an oval logo defined in spreading jet contrails. “Contrails Red” became the predominant color, while gold, orange, and black were retained as secondary colors. In 1991, a blue, white, and gold livery and a new globe logo was introduced. The logo continued to be used by #United after the merger. Did you ever fly on Continental?
