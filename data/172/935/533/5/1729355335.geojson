Designed by Frank Smith (1927–2007), chief designer at career wear manufacturer Evan-Picone, this uniform was meant to be “a functional and fashionable wardrobe that could be worn in all seasons, and of such quality that it would enhance the Pan Am image.” Image: Pan American World Airways, stewardesses and Boeing 747-100, c. 1971.
