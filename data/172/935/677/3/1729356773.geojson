Sunlight filters through the moisture, creating discrete layers of mountains—monochromatic and shifting with the movement of the sun, the atmosphere, and of me, flying above.” —Vanessa Marsh, 2019 \"The Sun Beneath the Sky\" continues Vanessa Marsh’s long-term practice of using cut paper, multiple exposures, and dodging and burning techniques to create cameraless photographic landscapes. Each unique lumen print is made by selectively exposing silver gelatin paper to sunlight and then processing the paper in photo chemicals to affix the image. In this way, the artist uses sunlight as both subject matter and medium.  See \"The Sun Beneath the Sky\" by Vanessa Marsh, on display, post-security in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2CiWxqi",
