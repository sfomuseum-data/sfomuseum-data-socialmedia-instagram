Linnaeus), the Swedish biologist who created the binomial system for naming species. This papier-mâché model was made by the manufactory of French surgeon Dr. Louis Auzoux in 1881 as a teaching tool for entomology students. All of the internal and external organs are labeled with their proper names in a style he called anatomie clastique (“broken in pieces”). Auzoux created similar models of humans, horses, and other animals.  See “The Intriguing World of Insects” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/IntriguingInsects",
