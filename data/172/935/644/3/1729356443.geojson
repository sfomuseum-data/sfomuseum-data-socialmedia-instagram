        "body": "The cockchafer beetle (Melolontha melolontha Linnaeus, 1758) is a well-known plant pest in Europe, and one of the first beetle species named by Carl von Linné (a.k.a. Linnaeus), the Swedish biologist who created the binomial system for naming species. This papier-mâché model was made by the manufactory of French surgeon Dr. Louis Auzoux in 1881 as a teaching tool for entomology students. All of the internal and external organs are labeled with their proper names in a style he called anatomie clastique (“broken in pieces”). Auzoux created similar models of humans, horses, and other animals.  See “The Intriguing World of Insects” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/IntriguingInsects",
