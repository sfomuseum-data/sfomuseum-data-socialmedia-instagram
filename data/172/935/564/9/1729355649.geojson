Named \"Clipper Young America,\" it departed New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 1:52AM and reached London's Heathrow Airport in 6 hours and 43 minutes. The new wide-body was twice the size of the Boeing 707. What are your fondest memories of the Boeing 747?  Image: Pan American World Airways postcard, Boeing 747, early 1970s.
