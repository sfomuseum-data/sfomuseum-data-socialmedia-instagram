In 2001, we presented \"Origami: The Art of Paper Folding\" featuring birds, fish, airplanes, rockets, and fantasy creatures made by students in after-school programs at Everett Middle School and Marshall Elementary School in San Francisco. Paper folding is an ancient art that originated in China around the first or second century A.D., reached Japan by the sixth century, and developed simultaneously under the Moors, who, forbidden by their religion to create representational art, explored all the folding aspects of the geometric square. Today, in the West, it is the province of schoolchildren. Do you remember this exhibition? ",
