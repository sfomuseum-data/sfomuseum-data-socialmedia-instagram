        "body": "This is your last week to see \"\"Maneki Neko: Japan's Beckoning Cats.\"\" During the late Edo period (1615â€“1868), Japanese artisans began making maneki neko or beckoning cat figurines, which have an upraised paw intending to draw people forth into businesses and homes. Maneki neko are a type of engimono or auspicious object believed to have the power to fulfill wishes for good fortune, prosperity, and happiness. Maneki neko often appear in Japanese and Chinese restaurant windows, where they silently summon potential customers to enter. Have you ever encountered a Maneki Neko?  This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum. \"Maneki Neko: Japan's Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
