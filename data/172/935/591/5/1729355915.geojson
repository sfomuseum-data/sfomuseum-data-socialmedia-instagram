Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Beechcraft improved their designs and differentiated models through the use of letters, A-G in their naming convention. Shown here is a G17 Staggerwing.  This model of the Beech Staggerwing was originally created for the Nut Tree Restaurant and Airfield Model Aircraft Collection in Vacaville, California. It was handmade and scratch-built by Edward “Eddie” Chavez in a 1:10 scale. The model was completed December 1968.  See more aircraft models created by Edward Chavez in “Masterworks by Edward Chavez: The Nut Tree Restaurant and Airfield Model Aircraft Collection” on display, pre-security, on the arrivals level of Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/32YbucL",
