        "body": "Happy 104th Birthday to Zoe Dell Lantis Nutter! She served as the official hostess for the 1939-1940 San Francisco Golden Gate International Exposition, where her duties included promoting commercial aviation at the Expo and the new commercial air route to Asia with Pan American Airways flying boats based next to the exposition grounds on Treasure Island. She had previously been a dancer with the San Francisco Ballet; after a show, she was approached by aviation executives who asked her if she was interested in promoting commercial aviation at the Expo. Soon after, she was traveling all over the country to promote aviation and the exposition. She eventually logged over 100,000 air miles. She was proclaimed by the National Clipping Service as the “Most Photographed Girl in the World.” Inspired by her time promoting aviation, she earned her pilot’s license after WWII. In 1988, she was elected the first woman President and then Chairman of the Board of the National Aviation Hall of Fame.  Image:  Zoe Dell Lantis Nutter, Treasure Island, San Francisco, c. 1939.
