        "body": "#Onthisday in 1971, Southwest Airlines began intrastate operations in Texas. The “Love Bird” service out of Dallas Love Field offered twelve daily round-trip flights from Dallas to Houston and six round-trip flights from Dallas to San Antonio on Boeing 737-200s. Since starting service, Southwest has the distinction of almost exclusively operating the Boeing 737 family, except for a brief period when the airline operated Boeing 727s. The airline inaugurated service to SFO in 1982. Have you ever flown on Southwest Airlines?  Image: Southwest Airlines poster, 1980s. Gift of Thomas G. Dragges. 2015.109.078",
