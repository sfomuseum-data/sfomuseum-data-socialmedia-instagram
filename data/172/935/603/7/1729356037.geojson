        "body": "Stanley Henry Page (1885-1964) was an early twentieth-century San Francisco Bay Area engineer who, like many young men of his generation, was inspired by the new technologies of flight. Page worked for a time at the Union Gas Engine Company, an East Oakland firm that built heavy marine engines. He had a small flying boat designed around one of his own aero engines and flew extensively around the Bay Area. Page merged his love of flying with another interest - that of glass plate photography. His images depict San Francisco Bay before its iconic bridges were built. Some of the locations he photographed are still recognizable today.  See “Above the Bay: The Aerial Photography of Stanley Page” now on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. ",
