It was smaller than the 747 yet had similar cabin spaciousness. It was also designed to be used at airports that could not handle the demands of the 747 and thus open up widebody operations more broadly. The DC-10 had a capacity for as many as 400 passengers. Have you ever flown on a DC-10? “Widebody: The Launch of the Jumbojets in the Early 1970s” is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/WidebodyAV",
