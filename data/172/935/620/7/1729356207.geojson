        "body": "Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848–1933) left a prodigious mark on American glass and decorative arts during his career that spanned nearly fifty years. Although his name is most often associated with his work in the medium of glass, he studied to be a painter before beginning a career as an interior designer during the late 1870s. He also designed furniture. Tiffany’s own residence in New York featured dining room walls covered in Japanese papers, a drawing room with Moorish columns, and a fireplace with mica panels in a spider web pattern. The unusual glass-bejeweled pedestals displayed here evoke Tiffany’s love of both exoticism and glass. “The Style of Display: Victorian Pedestals” is on display pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/VictorianPedestals",
