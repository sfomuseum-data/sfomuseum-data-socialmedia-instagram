The British Airways flight landed in Bahrain at 15:20 in four hours, well under the six and a half hours a subsonic aircraft would have taken. The Air France flight landed in Rio De Janeiro shortly after 19:00 after an hour and fifteen-minute technical stop in Dakar, Senegal. The Concorde had a cruising speed of March 2.2 or around 1,450 miles an hour.  Image: Air France postcard, Concorde, 1980s. Gift of Thomas G. Dragges. 2015.166.0148",
