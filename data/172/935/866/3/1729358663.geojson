Named \"Clipper Young America,\" it departed New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 1:52AM reaching London's Heathrow Airport in 6 hours and 43 minutes. The new wide-body was twice the size of the Boeing 707. At this time, there are no more Boeing 747s in US domestic commercial operation. What are your fondest memories of the Boeing 747?
