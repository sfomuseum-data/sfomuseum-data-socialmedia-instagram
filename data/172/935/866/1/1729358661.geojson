With over 2,000 different character slugs, the machine features d a large, sliding tray from which the typist could choose characters from. To operate, the typist positioned the tray and carriage along an x-y axis to select a type-slug, and depressed a button to retrieve, ink, and print.  Learn more about the typewriter in \"The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing\" on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/Thetypewriter",
