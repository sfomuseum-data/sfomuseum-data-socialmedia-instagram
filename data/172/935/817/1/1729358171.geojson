        "body": "The Curtiss Commando was initially designed by Curtiss-Wright’s chief designer George A. Page Jr. as a thirty-six passenger, pressurized commercial airliner. Redesigned for rugged military use and designated the C-46 Commando by the Army, the two-engine aircraft featured a highly aerodynamic, all-metal, double-bubble fuselage and could accommodate up to forty fully equipped troops in addition to cargo. After the war, Commandos were acquired as discounted military surplus by numerous commercial carriers. Some were reconfigured for passenger service, but most were operated as freight transports by commercial air cargo companies such as Slick Airways and the Flying Tiger Line.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
