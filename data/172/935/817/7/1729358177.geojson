        "body": "Happy Birthday to the Golden Gate Bridge! The Bridge is an internationally recognized symbol of San Francisco. The bridge spans almost two miles of water between Marin and San Francisco and held the title of the longest suspension bridge, main span, for almost 30 years. This gigantic undertaking started in 1933 and finished in 1937. Check out this amazing, black and white photograph of a ground-level view of construction of the Golden Gate Bridge taken on October 16, 1935, almost two years before construction is officially complete.
