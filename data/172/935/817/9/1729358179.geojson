        "body": "What a spectacular view! Taken on Telegraph Hill before Coit Tower was built, this 1925 photograph features the San Francisco Ferry Building, which opened in 1898. The ships in the background are blurry as the photographer, Stanley H. Page, had to hold the shutter open for a long exposure to take this night photo. Page, a mechanical engineer and aviator, took many of the earliest aerial photographs of the San Francisco Bay Area from his airplane in the 1920s; this photo is one of very few in our collection that he took on land, rather than in the air! Have you ever been to the San Francisco Ferry Building?  Image: San Francisco Bay area, night view from Telegraph Hill, 1925. Gift of Charles Page. 2010.174.290",
