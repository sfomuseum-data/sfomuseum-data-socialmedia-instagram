        "body": "Jim Lund, a Bay Area native, has a passionate interest in aviation dating back to his childhood when he first constructed aircraft models. Later in life, he returned to the practice and has dedicated much of his time to model building as a way to explore and experience the astonishingly rapid advancement of aviation since the first airplane. With a keen eye for detail, Lund’s research includes careful study of the photographic record to assure that his models are accurately portrayed. Numerous models were constructed or modified from kits produced by manufacturers worldwide. In the many instances when no kit was available, Lund crafted the model parts from scratch based on manufacturers’ plans using the “vacuform” process—a method that creates plastic parts from his hand-carved wood forms.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
