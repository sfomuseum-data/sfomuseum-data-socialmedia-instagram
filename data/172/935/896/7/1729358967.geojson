        "body": "“In the past the weaving process was very arduous. My grandmother told me that they used cotton; they didn’t buy yarn as we do now; they had to prepare everything. I don't know where they got it; only that they had a place where they prepared the cotton and then they wove the blouses and the men’s clothing. We no longer have to do all that. Now we buy the thread in the stores; it is ready to use and we only have to make balls and can weave it quickly. We cannot compare the work of our grandmothers with the work we do today. Life has changed, but I don't know if it has improved or worsened.” —Magdalena López López, Weaver, Jolom Mayaetik Weaving Chiapas: Maya Women’s Lives in a Changing World  Blouse courtesy of Charlene M. Woodcock. Learn more about \"Empowering Threads: Textiles of Jolom Mayaetik\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/EmpoweringThreads",
