These bags were sold through mail-order catalogs, at airport stores, and handed out to customers at travel and tourist agencies. By the late 1950s, United featured service promotions on their bags along with the airline’s newly-introduced Douglas DC-8 Jet Mainliner. Miniature children’s versions of the flight bags filled with candy were also available at airport gift shops.
