        "body": "Shortly after the United States Supreme Court ruling on June 26, 2015, that guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry, civic buildings across the country and around the world were illuminated in the colors of the rainbow. The rainbow flag, introduced nearly forty years earlier at San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade, was unfurled from apartment balconies, attached to car windows, and appeared in the background for tens of millions of newly changed profile photos on social media accounts as a universally recognized symbol of pride and solidarity.  Our newest exhibition, \"A Legacy of Pride: Gilbert Baker and the 40th Anniversary of the Rainbow Flag\" celebrates the creator and history of the iconic flag. #ALegacyOfPride is on view pre-security in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/RainbowFlagSFO",
