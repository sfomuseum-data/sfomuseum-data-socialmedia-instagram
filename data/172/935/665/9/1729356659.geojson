        "body": "Initially trained as a painter, Miriam Hanid was introduced to silversmithing while studying mixed-media art at the University for the Creative Arts at Farnham in South East England. Hanid takes an artistic, painterly approach to silver, incorporating chasing, engraving, and repoussé to add detail to her sculptural forms. In 2011, the artist hand-raised and chased her Winding Ways vase from a single, rectangular sheet of silver. Her surface decoration is inspired by the momentary pattern of flowing water and its “subtle yet powerful ability to shape the landscape.” Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
