Back at the studio, he searched the many photos to find an image with the perfect balance of movement, rhythm, space, and “an energy akin to music.” Chronister then digitally changed the source photo into black and white, bumped up the contrast, and projected the image onto the canvas. Using a very small brush, he painted with black oil paint directly from the projection, and over the course of a few months, the completed landscape emerged.
