This fanciful house has decorative wooden shingles with an elaborate rooftop and entryway finials. The house's wooden front and back fa√ßades mimic bricks, while a small side addition appears to be a chapel attached to the house.  Folk house is courtesy of the collection of Ian Berke. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
