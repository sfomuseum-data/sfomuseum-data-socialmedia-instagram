        "body": "This is your last week to see \"Caticons: The Cat in Art.\" Cats have charmed people with their mysterious allure for thousands of years. As adept hunters, many domestic cats are self-sufficient creatures with characteristically nonchalant, independent personalities. This exhibition explores the history of the cat and its allure through art, literature, and decorative arts from around the world.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/Caticons",
