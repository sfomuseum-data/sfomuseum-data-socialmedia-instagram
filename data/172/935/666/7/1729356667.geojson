        "body": "Ryan McClean was raised on the shores of Scotland’s Loch Nevis and became fascinated by nature from an early age. He attended Manchester Metropolitan University from 2001 to 2004, where he worked with a multitude of materials while completing his degree in Three Dimensional Design. Recognizing his aptitude for metalwork, McClean completed post-graduate coursework in jewelry making and silversmithing at Bishopsland Educational Trust. After serving as artist-in-residence at the Glasgow School of Art from 2006 to 2008, McClean established a studio and workshop in Sheffield where he produces a diverse range of work. Much of his output reflects his interest in the science behind the growth and pattern formation in naturally formed material. McClean hand-raised this vase from a single sheet of silver and hammered the texture onto the pitch-supported form.  Special thanks to The Pearson Silver Collection. \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/BritishSilver",
