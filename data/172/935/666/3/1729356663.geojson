        "body": "In his series, \"The Light of Water\", Napa-based artist Jock McDonald reflects on the cyclical qualities of water and its ability to transform, unify, and connect each of us to the natural world. Utilizing images of the ocean, clouds, and tide pools made during his travels in Cuba over the past ten years, McDonald works in his studio to carefully deconstruct multiple large-scale prints of each photograph. Working by hand, he intertwines and rejoins the photographs to produce a single woven object. In doing so, McDonald abstracts the images and introduces an aqueous quality that draws attention to the surface of the photograph and invites viewers to meditate upon their own relationship with water. \"The Light of Water\" by artist Jock McDonald is on display pre-security, in Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2uHT3tq",
