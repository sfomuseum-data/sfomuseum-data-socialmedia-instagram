With a Stearman 4 and two Lockheed Model 10 Electras, TCA took to the skies; the airline's first flight was from Vancouver to Seattle on September 1, 1937. The flight carried mail and two passengers whose round-trip tickets each cost $14.20 CAD, or $176.75 USD in today's currency. TCA was renamed Air Canada in 1965. Did you ever fly on TCA?
