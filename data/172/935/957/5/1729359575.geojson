Kislingbury\" capture the usage of objects similar to those on display in \"#GamesofChance: Gambling Devices of the Mechanical Age\". Many of the color-wheel and roulette-based gambling devices, popularized as freestanding machines in carved, wooden cabinets, were also produced as ornate, cast-iron versions for the countertops of saloons and cigar stores.  On the far right side of this photo from 1904 is a machine very similar to The Wasp, a color-wheel machine from 1904.  All objects are courtesy of the Joe Welch American Antique Museum. See \"#GamesofChance: Gambling Devices of the Mechanical Age\" and the accompanying photography show, \"The American Saloon: Historical Photographs from the Collection of Roger E. Kislingbury\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/AmericanSaloon",
