        "body": "Clogs, carved wooden shoes, are made from a single piece of wood. Poplar, willow, birch, and alder were common wood types used in the Netherlands and France. Antique clogs are rare because old clogs were typically used for firewood once they wore out. Known as klomp in the Netherlands and sabot in France, they were worn throughout many parts of Europe beginning in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. Clogs were often worn by people working in the fields to keep their feet from getting blemished or muddy; by industrial workers in factories; by market sellers, such as fishmongers; and also by the upper classes while outdoors to protect their feet and clothing from the elements. Clog makers could be found in villages in Europe through the early twentieth century.
