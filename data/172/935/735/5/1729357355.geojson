        "body": "#HappyBirthday to Isamu Noguchi. Born #onthisday in 1904 in Los Angeles to an American-born mother and a Japanese father, Noguchi became a bicultural ambassador between the East and the West. One of the most influential artists of his generation, Noguchi worked across multiple mediums to create a distinct mid-century style. Our exhibition celebrates Noguchi's desire to create three-dimensional sculptures from two-dimensional materials.  Thank you to The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum for their generous loan. See \"Isamu Noguchi: Inside and Out\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://ow.ly/49B050jIvmQ . . .",
