        "body": "Introduced to Europe from Japan in the 16th century, fans were an essential fashion accessory in the formal dress of a wealthy woman. They helped to cool a lady’s face and could be used as a subtle tool for flirting with suitors. Painted and lace-embellished fans were common around the turn of the 20th century, when French painter Adolphe Thomasse (1850­–1930) decorated fans with a menagerie of animal images, including cats, often for the famous fan-maker Duvelleroy of Paris.  A very special thank you to Sandy Lerner for making this exhibition possible. See \"Caticons: The Cat in Art\" is on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://ow.ly/wU4t50jIvPN . . .",
