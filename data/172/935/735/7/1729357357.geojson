With the introduction of the “Cutaway” uniform in the mid-1940s, a new silver pin was created by the V. H. Blackinton \u0026 Company of Attleboro, Massachusetts, featuring a Boeing 307 Stratoliner and an arrow. By the 1960s, hostess insignia were gold plated and incorporated the carrier’s double-globe logo. ",
