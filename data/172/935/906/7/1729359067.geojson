        "body": "The mid-1930s were heady times for airlines across the United States. Routes were expanding and new, streamlined, all-metal airliners were starting to enter service. At the same time, new developments were also expanding the horizons of commercial publishing as Kodak’s new Kodachrome film was making color photography a practical reality. This calendar is a very early example of commercial color photography. The note accompanying this calendar boasts “All of these striking color photographs… were enlarged from Kodachrome film only a little larger than an air-mail stamp– the first calendar, to our knowledge, to be so illustrated.  See \"The #YearsFlyBy: Airline Calendars from the Collection\" on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library. http://bit.ly/YearsFlyBy  Image: American Airlines wall calendar, 1938.
