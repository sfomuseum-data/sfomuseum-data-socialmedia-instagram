        "body": "In no part of the world did gambling take place so openly and on such a large scale than in San Francisco during the Victorian era. At the beginning of the twentieth century, more than 3,000 machines operated freely, enticing customers from busy sidewalks into the saloons and cigar stores that proliferated throughout San Francisco. While gambling machines were enormously popular, they also earned the scorn of critics. Social reformers targeted the devices as a destructive influence on families while hammer-wielding civic leaders regularly posed before heaps of the destroyed machines.  The overwhelming number of slot machines in San Francisco led to a citywide ban in 1909. The law was ignored for two years and the machines were then outlawed statewide.  The sign in this photo reads, \"Look!  Our machines are open for inspection! One winning hand only. Specials payed on correct hands and not on hands of more.  Manipulating or knocking over of cards forfeits all Claims. Marks and Bottled Goods for checks on special schedule. No Checks redeemable in culinary department. Specials To Day All Red pays 1 of drinks or cigars All Black “  1 “ \"",
