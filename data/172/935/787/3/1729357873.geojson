        "body": "A preeminent French couturier, Pierre Balmain (1914–1982) opened his fashion house in 1945. He was highly successful at translating Parisian styles into ready-to-wear collections for American markets. To dress TWA’s 2,400 hostesses, he created this 1965 summer uniform in fabric mill-dyed to specification for the turquoise and white color scheme. The worsted wool skirt is matched with a collarless demi-fitted jacket in oyster worsted Dacron. Snap-in cuffs coordinated with the blouse-slip made of a drip-dry synthetic faille with an asymmetrical collar. The semi-beret shell-style hat, trimmed in white piping, has a grosgrain cockade for the insignia.  Image: TWA (Trans World Airlines) [digital image], 1960s.
