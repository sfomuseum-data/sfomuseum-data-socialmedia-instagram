A huge logistical challenge, our collections staff has inventoried, labelled, and packed every object - over 35,000 items out of over 125,000! - that need to be moved. Our new collections storage has been designed with all of these objects in mind, from tiny swizzle sticks and uniform pins to oversize model airplanes and airplane seats",
