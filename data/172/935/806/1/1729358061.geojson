In 2009, the Korean War Memorial Foundation, a non-profit organization, undertook the mission to design and build a Korean War memorial in San Francisco to commemorate the sacrifices made by those who fought in the so-called “Forgotten War,” educate future generations about those sacrifices, and ensure that those generations never forget the true cost of war. The memorial was completed and officially opened to the public in August of 2016. Have you ever been to the Korean War Memorial in San Francisco?  See photographs from \"San Francisco Korean War Memorial\" on display, pre-security, on the departures level of Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2ymCPdF",
