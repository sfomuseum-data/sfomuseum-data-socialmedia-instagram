        "body": "#HappyBirthday to Juan Trippe, the late President of Pan American World Airways, who was born #onthisday in 1899. Trippe became interested in aviation at an early age. Trained as a Navy aviator during World War I, he graduated from Yale University and worked briefly on Wall Street before starting Long Island Airways in 1922. During the mid-1920s, he served as general manager of Colonial Air Transport, yet longed to create his own airline. In 1927, he reformed Aviation Corporation of the Americas as a holding company to merge competing interests establishing Pan American Airways as the operating division. Pan Am’s first flight was a mail delivery to Cuba in October of the same year. Over the next five decades, with Trippe’s vision and entrepreneurial zeal, Pan Am became an innovative business model that drew the blue print for the global air transport system. Its unrivaled string of aviation firsts included first commercial service across the oceans in fixed wing aircraft, first successful jet service, first widebody service, and a worldwide system of subsidiaries and partnership businesses related to the aviation industry.
