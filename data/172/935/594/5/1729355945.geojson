British Airways had announced in April 2003 that they would be retiring their Concordes. The Concorde could reach supersonic speeds of up to Mach II (around 1,450 miles an hour) and could travel from New York to London in under 4 hours. Tickets cost up to $9,000 round-trip. Did you ever fly on a Concorde?  Image: British Airways, Concorde, c. 2000. Gift of David Robinson. 2010.044.002",
