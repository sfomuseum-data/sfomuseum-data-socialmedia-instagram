        "body": "The Airbus A300 was the first wide-body airliner produced by Airbus Industries, a European aerospace manufacturing consortium formed in 1970. The fuselage of the A300 was wide enough to seat eight across in economy, which was arranged in a two-four-two configuration with two aisles. The first-class cabin seated six across, also with two aisles, in a two-two-two arrangement. The A300 could carry as many as 266 passengers in this two-class configuration, which was a similar capacity to the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L1011 TriStar widebody airliners, but with two engines instead of three the A300 used approximately thirty percent less fuel. This amounted to a substantial reduction in operating costs for the airlines flying the aircraft, and was one of the major reasons for the aircraftâ€™s success. The A300 established Airbus as a major European airliner manufacturer.  Image: Singapore Airlines poster, Airbus A300, c. 1981. Gift of the William Hough Collection. 2006.010.273",
