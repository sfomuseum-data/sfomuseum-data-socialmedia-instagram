        "body": "Harvey Bernard Milk (1930–78) was a visionary human rights leader, a groundbreaking political luminary, and a seminal figure of the LGBTQ rights movement. In the late 1970s, Milk was part of a coalition that successfully led the efforts to defeat California ballot measure Proposition 6, an initiative to prohibit openly gay men and women from working in California’s public schools. The measure also allowed for those teachers who openly supported gays and lesbians to be fired as well. In a rally against Proposition 6, Harvey Milk is joined by his friends and political allies, including co-organizer of the “No on 6” campaign, teacher Tom Ammiano (b. 1941), holding the “Gay Teachers \u0026 School Workers” sign. The measure’s defeat at the ballot box in November was aided by public opposition from prominent politicians such as Mayor Moscone, California Governor Jerry Brown, former California Governor Ronald Reagan, and then-President Jimmy Carter.
