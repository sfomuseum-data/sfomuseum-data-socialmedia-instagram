        "body": "Introduced on April 1,1949 by Pan American World Airways, the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser was considered the most luxurious airliner in the skies. Its unique, pressurized, “double-bubble” fuselage was equipped with two decks; the upper contained a roomy main cabin, with passenger accommodations for up to 100, depending on the seating configuration, while the lower featured the highly popular cocktail lounge. Conceived by Walter Dorwin Teague, the lounge was accessed by a spiral staircase, had wrap-around, sofa-style seating for up to fourteen. Because of this lower lounge, the aircraft was often used by airlines for luxury or first-class service.
