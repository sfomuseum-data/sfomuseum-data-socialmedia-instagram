        "body": "Prior to European colonization, Native American footwear displayed a variety of distinctive adornment and design styles. Materials varied depending on the climate and what was locally available. Making moccasins was a skill passed from one generation to the next. Women were generally responsible for preparing and tanning the hides, cutting and sewing the moccasins using thread made from animal sinew, and embellishing the footwear. Moccasins are highly decorated, especially along the top seam, using beads, vegetable dyes, animal fur, ribbons, embroidery, appliqu√©, porcupine quills, and decorative metal cones. Some of these materials, such as glass beads, which became available in the mid-1700s, were acquired through trade with European-Americans. Decorations including animals, plants, and geometric designs indicated the skill of the maker as well as the cultural affiliations of the group.  Shoes courtesy of the California Academy of Sciences.
