        "body": "In the mid-1960s, American commercial aviation was primed for transformation. Jet aircraft were shrinking the globe and a new generation of airline executives was taking the reins from those who had grown the industry from biplanes landing in grass fields to a billion-dollar enterprise that moved millions of people every year. In 1965, Mary Wells delivered an advertising campaign dubbed The End of the Plain Plane to #Braniff International that looked like nothing anyone had seen before.  Almost overnight, Wellâ€™s campaign transformed Braniff International from a respectably conservative, mid-sized Texas airline to an international icon of American youthful creativity and prosperity that captured the age like no other campaign had done before. \"When You Got it- Flaunt It: #AdvertisingBraniff International\" is on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum and Library.
