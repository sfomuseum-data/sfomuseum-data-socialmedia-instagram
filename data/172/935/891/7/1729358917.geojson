        "body": "Ceremonial huipiles are among the most elaborate Mayan textiles. The finest garments are woven for the saints of fiestas and include extensive brocade and embroidery. Ceremonial textile weaving often fulfills sociocultural roles performed outside of the household known as cargos. These important roles include positions as shamans, midwives, leaders of cooperatives or fiestas, and weavers of sacred garments. Ceremonial weaving is a major undertaking, requiring months of dedicated work and financial resources that are rarely available. In addition to the thread and materials needed, expenses are incurred on the journey from the weaver’s village to the church if there is a formal procession. Religious festivities are financed by the weaver’s family, with food, beverage, incense, and fireworks purchased as necessary to properly offer a saint their new garment. Ceremonial textiles are also made to wear on special occasions, represented by this ceremonial huipil from the town of Magdalenas in Aldama, north of San Andrés.
