        "body": "The Dornier Do X flying boat was the largest airplane built at the time of its introduction in 1929. With twelve, twelve-cylinder-inline engines mounted back-to-back on six wing-top tower nacelles, it could carry up to one hundred passengers at a cruising speed of just over one hundred miles an hour. In November 1930, the aircraft departed from Friedrichshafen, Germany, on a planned transatlantic flight to New York, but after sustaining damage in Lisbon, eventually flew to West Africa and across the South Atlantic to Natal, Brazil. The aircraft arrived in New York in August 1931 and, after hundreds toured it, departed on May 21, 1932. After stops in Newfoundland and the Azores, the Do X arrived on May 24, 1932, at MÃ¼ggelsee Lake, Berlin, amid thousands of cheering spectators.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features nearly 300 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
