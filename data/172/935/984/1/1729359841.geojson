        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1933, the first flight of the Boeing 247 took place. In early 1933, Boeing Aircraft Company of Seattle, Washington introduced a groundbreaking all-metal aircraft, the 247—often referred to as the first modern airliner. By using semi-monocoque construction with a fully cantilevered wing, and retractable landing gear, Boeing produced a clean, low-drag fuselage, with no wires or struts common to most airliners at that time. In promotional materials and articles Boeing’s affiliate company United Air Lines, the sole U.S. operator, emphasized the new ten-passenger airliner’s dependability, comfort, and speed. #avgeek #aviationhistory  Image: United Air Lines postcard, Boeing 247D, 1930s, Gift of Captain Jon Simmonds, 2015.057.472",
