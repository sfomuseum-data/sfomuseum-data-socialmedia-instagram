These selections from the author’s collection offer a glimpse into environments made largely extinct by the enactment of Prohibition in 1920 and provide historic context for that nearly ubiquitous feature in saloons and cigar stands during the earliest years of the twentieth century—the mechanical gambling device.  See \"#GamesofChance: Gambling Devices of the Mechanical Age\" and the accompanying photography show, \"The American Saloon: Historical Photographs from the Collection of Roger E. Kislingbury\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/AmericanSaloon",
