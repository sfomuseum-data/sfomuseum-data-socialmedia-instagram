        "body": "Although single-lever slot machines were referred to as “one-armed bandits” as early as the 1930s, the term became more literal in the late 1940s when saloons and casinos featured the gambling devices in the bodies of elaborately carved characters to attract the attention of patrons.  Frank Polk (1908–2000) was employed as a professional ranch hand, rodeo cowboy, and stuntman in Hollywood westerns before embarking on a career as an artist. His work experiences provided inspiration for his sculptures in basswood and bronze. During the 1940s and 1950s, Polk carved nearly 100 distinct, life-sized figures to house slot machines, including this noteworthy example that is believed to feature a likeness of the artist.  All objects are courtesy of Joe Welch American Antique Museum. See \"#GamesofChance: Gambling Devices of the Mechanical Age\" and the accompanying photography show, \"The American Saloon: Historical Photographs from the Collection of Roger E. Kislingbury\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/GamesofChance",
