        "body": "What did flight gear look like in 1932? Protective clothing was developed to mitigate harsh conditions, and aviator equipment was marketed to a growing number of private, commercial, and military flyers at home and abroad. Head coverings, eyewear, facemasks, jackets, pants, one-piece coverall suits, gloves, and boots were all designed to accommodate the human side of the flying equation. Such full-body gear became standard on pilotsâ€™ checklists, and much of it remained in use up to and during the World War II period of the 1940s.
