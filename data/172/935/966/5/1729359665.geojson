        "body": "The mid-1930s were heady times for airlines across the United States. Routes were expanding and new, streamlined, all-metal airliners were starting to enter service. At the same time, new developments were also expanding the horizons of commercial publishing as Kodak’s new Kodachrome film was making color photography a practical reality. Ivan Dmitri, the photographic pseudonym of the American artist Levon West (1900–68), was a pioneer in promoting the widespread use of color photography and published one of the first books on the subject in 1939. Dmitri had a life-long interest in aviation, and it was frequently the subject of his work.
