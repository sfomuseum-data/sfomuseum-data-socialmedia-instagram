Many bibs display auspicious symbols. The Kutani kilns designed some of the most sumptuously decorated bibs, applying painted designs with raised patterning. The white cat on display at left appears with a black kitten resting against her belly; both exhibit elaborate Kutani bibs. This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum. \"Maneki Neko: Japanese Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
