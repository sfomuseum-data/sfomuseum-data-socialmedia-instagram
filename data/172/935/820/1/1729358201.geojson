        "body": "Do you wonder where your fish and shellfish may come from? The photographs in Corey Arnold’s series, “Aleutian Dreams”, revolve around the remote port town of Dutch Harbor, located in the Aleutian Islands between the Gulf of Alaska and the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula. Isolated from the mainland by some of the world’s most treacherous waters, Dutch Harbor is a thriving commercial fishing port nestled between steep mountains and dramatic, windswept valleys. As much a participant as an observer, Arnold offers a unique glimpse into the inner workings of an industry that, despite its popularity at the dinner table, has largely escaped the attention of visual culture in modern times. His images draw focus on the ever-complicated relationship between humanity and nature as he documents the experiences of those working in notoriously dangerous yet visually striking environments.  See “Aleutian Dreams” by Corey Arnold, on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/2KnSn21",
