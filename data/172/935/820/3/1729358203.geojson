        "body": "#OnThisDay in 1927, Charles A. Lindbergh landed in Paris, France, making aviation history. The Ryan NYP “Spirit of St. Louis” was built by Ryan Airlines in San Diego specifically for Lindbergh to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and win the New York–Paris Orteig Prize. On May 20, 1927, from Roosevelt Field, New York, Lindbergh flew a solo, non-stop, transatlantic flight of approximately 3,600 miles that lasted over thirty-three hours. He arrived the next day at Le Bourget Airport, Paris. By completing this first solo, non-stop, transatlantic flight, Lindbergh immediately became an international aviation superstar.  See \"Aviation Evolutions: The Jim Lund 1:72 Scale Model Airplane Collection\", which features more than 200 models, on display, pre-security, in the Aviation Museum. http://bit.ly/AviationEvolutions",
