        "body": "Armed with a new sense of patriotism following the Revolutionary War, farmers and settlers produced a variety of uniquely American weathervanes. Many farmers depicted domestic animalsâ€”cows, pigs, and roosters, horses and dogs. People living near the coast often featured fish and other nautical imagery on weathervanes. A belief around depicting Native Americans on weathervanes was that doing so would bring good luck. During the 1920s, the use of weathervanes declined with the advent of the radio (check out our exhibition on those, too!) and commercial weather forecasts. Have you ever seen a weathervane like this one?  Weathervane courtesy of the collection of the Landis Valley Village and Farm Museum, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. See \"#AmericanFolkArt: An Enduring Legacy\", on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/AmericanFolkArt",
