        "body": "Happy Birthday #UnitedAirlines! Did you know that United is the longest serving airline at San Francisco International Airport? Boeing Air Transport entered into an agreement with San Francisco on March 11, 1927, to make Mills Field its western terminus on the condition that the facility was completed by July 1 to the specifications of the airmail contract. However, no hangar space was available until September, so Boeing was forced to use Concord and Oakland. Later, Boeing Air Transport would merge into a company that would one day return as United Air Lines.  Image: Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco, Boeing 40A, C.A.M. 18, 9/16/1927.
