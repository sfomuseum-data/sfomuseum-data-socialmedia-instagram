Through Root Divisionâ€™s Latinx Teaching-Artist Fellowship, artists Greta Liz Anderson and Beatriz Vasquez collaborated and taught art classes to youth at Mission Education Center, a K-5 public school that serves students who have recently immigrated from Latin America. During the past year, these young artists created a body of work that reflects the process of migrating to a new place and of adjustment and growth, while remembering, honoring, and celebrating their heritage and native cultures. The projects created for \"My Two Homes\" are an exploration of immigration experiences, a collection of memories, and a celebration and preservation of stories.  @rootdivision is a visual arts non-profit organization located in the SoMa District of San Francisco. They strive to empower artists, foster community service, inspire youth, and enrich the Bay Area through engagement in the visual arts. See \"My Two Homes\" by students from Mission Education Center on display, pre-security, on the arrivals level of Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/2v3Tc9Z",
