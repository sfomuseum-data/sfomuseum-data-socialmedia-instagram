        "body": "The Golden Gate International Exposition was held from February 1939 to September 1940 to celebrate construction of the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The exposition was installed on Treasure Island, a 400-acre artificial island constructed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) from 1936 to 1937. Technologies such as radio and television were promoted at both expositions, and a number of radios were introduced to commemorate the events, including two versions of the 40X–50 series by RCA, and the magnificent “World's Fair Special” by Zenith. \"On the Radio\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/RadioSFO",
