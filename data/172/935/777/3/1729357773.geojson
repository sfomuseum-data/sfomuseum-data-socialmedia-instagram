Bibs range from a simple cord and bell to an ornately patterned and colorful accessory. Many bibs display symbols of good luck and fortune.  This exhibition was made possible by a generous loan from Mingei International Museum. \"Maneki Neko: Japan's Beckoning Cat\" is on display post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/BeckoningCats",
