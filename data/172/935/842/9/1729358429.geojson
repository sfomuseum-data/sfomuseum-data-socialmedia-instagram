Jolom Mayaetik, which translates to \"Women Who Weave\" from Mayan Tzotzil, was founded in 1996 and is one of the most progressive weaving cooperatives in Chiapas. Committed to improving the lives of indigenous women in Chiapas, members of the Jolom Mayaetik are weaving with a collective voice.  See \"Empowering Threads: Textiles of Jolom Mayaetik\" on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. http://bit.ly/EmpoweringThreads",
