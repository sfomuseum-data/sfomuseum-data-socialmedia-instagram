        "body": "It’s National Park Week! Did you know that there used to be an airline named National Parks Airways? Though tiny, it served Utah, Idaho, and Montana in the 1920s and ‘30s, was successful enough to acquire three Boeing 247 aircraft, one of which is featured on its 1937 calendar. In this same year, the airline was absorbed by the Western Air Lines system.  Image: National Parks Airways Boeing 247 aircraft wall calendar, 1937.  Gift of Captain Jon Simmonds, 2014.156.004",
