        "body": "In April 1935, the Douglas DC-1 set a record for the fastest transcontinental flight at eleven hours and five minutes. Introduced in 1933, only one was ever designed and built as a prototype for TWA (Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air). It led to the development of the later DC-2 production airliner. The DC-1 carried 12 passengers and had a maximum speed of 210 mph. The plane was sold multiple times, eventually ending up with Iberia Airlines. In 1940, while in operation with the airline it was damaged beyond repair. Whatâ€™s the fastest you ever flew across the continent?
