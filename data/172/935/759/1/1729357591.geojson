        "body": "Opening tomorrow: \"A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957 to 2018.\" This exhibition, located pre-security in the International Terminal, highlights pieces of silver art made by modern British silversmiths. Showcasing a distinctively English style of silver that is â€œrugged, solid, and functional, but at the same time modern,\" this exhibition features 35 British silversmiths.  Special thanks to our exhibition partner John Andrew, curator of The Pearson Silver Collection; and to The Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, London; the Incorporation of Goldsmiths, Edinburgh; and to designer-silversmiths Malcolm Appleby and Angus McFadyen for their generous participation in this exhibition. http://ow.ly/gWok50jkT5v . . .",
