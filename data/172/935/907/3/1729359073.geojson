After starting her air traffic control career in Salt Lake as one of first American women in the profession, Maxine Crookston moved to San Francisco. Featured in the High Deseret News Society in 1941, an interesting observation from the publication was that aviation was one of the most popular sports for Salt Lake City's \"younger sets.\" Image: Deseret News Society, Maxine Crookston (Schmidt), air traffic controller, 1941.
