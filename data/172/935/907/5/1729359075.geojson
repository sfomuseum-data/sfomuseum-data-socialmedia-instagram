        "body": "A pioneer in avionics, United was the first transportation company to install a two-way, coast-to-coast teletype service. Set up in 1938, it linked stations all along the Main Line from New York to San Francisco. A radio relay system was also used to track airplane movement. As an airplane passed radio receivers located along each route segment, a signal was automatically transmitted to the ground station’s flight dispatch clock. The dispatcher would then move a pin with the corresponding flight number one position closer to the center of the clock board to plot the flight’s progress.  See \"Flying the Main Line: A History of United Air Lines\", on display, post-security, in Terminal 3. http://bit.ly/TheMainLine",
