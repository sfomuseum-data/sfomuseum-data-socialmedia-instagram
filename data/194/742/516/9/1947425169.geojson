        "body": "In 1927, Harold Bixby joined a consortium of St. Louis businessmen to help finance Charles Lindbergh’s (1902-74) historic non-stop transatlantic flight later that year. Bixby is seen here smiling just behind and to the left of Charles Lindbergh. Lindbergh named his plane “The Spirit of St. Louis” in their honor. This connection led Bixby, at age forty-three, to accept a position with Pan American Airways (PAA) to manage the airline’s interests in Asia, primarily PAA’s partnership in the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and opening transpacific flying boat service. Bixby joined Pan American in 1933 and worked for the airline for the rest of his career, retiring in 1955.  “Unlocking an Archival Treasure: The Harold Bixby Collection” is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. Located pre-security in the International Terminal, the Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. https://www.sfomuseum.org/exhibitions/harold-bixby-collection",
