        "body": "Choreographer Danielle Rowe’s first repertory length work for San Francisco Ballet faced a complex path due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. 𝘞𝘰𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘯 𝘋𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘴, a 1920s Art Deco ballet takes its name from an American saying of the era, “Don’t take any wooden nickels,” a caution to be careful not to get swindled. For the narrative, Rowe explains, “I wanted to look at that space between what I call the real world and the magical world of the theater; particularly the dressing room space, where you put on makeup, change your hair, and transform into somebody else. It can consume you as a performer—there’s an energy and shared experience in that space that’s like nothing else.” Rowe’s story revolves around a married couple, Robert and Betty Fine. As a chorus girl, Betty rises to stardom and Robert remains stuck in a dull, repetitive job.   Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
