        "body": "Fiber artist Kay Sekimachi studied silk screen printing and watercolor painting at California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC, now California College of the Arts) in Oakland. When she happened upon students in the CCAC weaving room in 1949, Sekimachi was spellbound by the rhythm of “the harnesses going up and down and the girls throwing the shuttle.” The following day, Sekimachi used her remaining savings to purchase a four-harness loom from Ahrens Weaving Studio in Berkeley. No longer able to afford CCAC, she took free weaving classes at McKinley Adult School in Berkeley, assisted with workshops at Ahrens, and joined the Contemporary Handweavers and the Loom and Shuttle Guild.   A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible. See \"Kay Sekimachi: Weaving Traditions\" on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. https://www.sfomuseum.org/exhibitions/kay-sekimachi-weaving",
