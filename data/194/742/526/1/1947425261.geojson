Possokhov takes this concept of a man “swimming home” and weaves together images, moments, and settings from author Jack London’s Martin Eden (1909), J. D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye (1951), Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita (1955), as well as artist Edward Hopper’s painting Nighthawks (1942), and director Mike Nichols’ film The Graduate (1967). Scene changes happen with the aid of film sequences, which reflect Possokhov’s love of moving images, while giving a nod to Hollywood, another American cultural icon.   In the ballet’s last movement, the Swimmer is multiplied by fifteen men. “It’s him, all of them, Possokhov says—one man’s emotions, magnified.” The men dance with the fluidity and weightlessness that come with immersion in water, yet there is ferocity too. “It’s like a kind of confession,” he continues. The mad dance is a “last song, last scream, last swim.” Then the men are washed away, leaving only the Swimmer onstage.   Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
