        "body": "An engineering marvel, the Art Deco-inspired Golden Gate Bridge has stood as an iconic symbol of San Francisco since its opening in 1937. Architect Irving Morrow (1884‚Äì1952) selected its distinctive international orange color. Discussions for a bridge to span the Golden Gate Strait, which joins San Francisco Bay with the Pacific Ocean, began in the late nineteenth century before a serious campaign commenced in 1916. Bridge construction started in 1933, led by chief engineer Joseph Strauss (1870‚Äì1938). At the time of its completion, the bridge was the longest and tallest suspension bridge ever constructed. Because of the hazardous construction conditions, Strauss instituted rigorous safety measures not commonly used at the time, such as using hard hats, glare-free goggles, and a safety net that stretched end to end underneath the bridge.
