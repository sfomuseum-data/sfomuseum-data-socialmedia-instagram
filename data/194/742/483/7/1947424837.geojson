        "body": "After World War II, the domestic carrier Transcontinental \u0026 Western Air (TWA) added many new international routes to Europe and beyond and changed its name to Trans World Airlines. To promote European destinations in the late 1950s, David Klein created a series of eye-catching posters in colorful styles featuring TWAâ€™s newly introduced state-of-the-art Lockheed L-1649 Starliner.   In his Paris poster he used a style suggestive of French Impressionism to create a view of the Eiffel Tower from the entrance to the Place du TrocadÃ©ro. At the bottom he depicts two nuns and a group of schoolgirls, reminiscent of the popular childrenâ€™s book Madeline.   By contrast, in his Spain and Italy posters he used a modern three-dimensional style. His Spain poster highlights one of the countryâ€™s popular attractions, the bullfights, with intricately dressed matadors.   In his poster for Italy, he features Veniceâ€™s most recognizable landmark, the Piazza San Marco, or St. Markâ€™s Square, with St. Markâ€™s Basilica and the Campanile bell tower.
