        "body": "Happy Valentine’s Day! These cute love notes from Mike to Aloha were kept in a five-year diary collected by Unknown Museum curator and archivist Mickey McGowan. McGowan would frequent garage sales, flea markets, and estate liquidations to collect commonplace artifacts of American consumerism to display at the Unknown Museum in Mill Valley. The five-year diary is on display in our “Recollections… from the Unknown Museum” exhibition, although the notes are too fragile for prolonged exposure to light.  They read:   “Aloha: who do you like ___  Open second note if it is me Mike” “Dear Aloha, Madam will you please acomadate me to the dance tomoroe night Mike”  “I like you a lot. You’re a swell girl and if I can go to the hop will you go with me?”  “Darling Aloha Love you Dearly Sweetly Honestly  Lovingly Mike Butler”  A very special thank you to Mickey McGowan for making this exhibition possible. See “Recollections… from the Unknown Museum” on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. https://ow.ly/EIq050QBm2b",
