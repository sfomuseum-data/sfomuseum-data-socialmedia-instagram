        "body": "Mark von Arenburg enjoyed a prolific art career from the 1920s to the 1950s. Born in England, he immigrated to the United States with his parents as a small child in the early 1900s. He first drew political cartoons for newspapers. He then moved to New York City during the 1920s and began painting posters, initially for the Rivoli, Rialto, and Paramount Theatres, and then for the Roxy Theatre, where he served as chief designer and poster illustrator. In 1932, he became the chief artist for Radio City Music Hall, a position he retained until his retirement in the early 1950s. During the 1930s, von Arenburg created sets in Hollywood, first for Walt Disney and later for Paramount. In the 1950s, his noncommercial work was shown in several New York City exhibitions. These included paintings and drawings of scenes in New York City and Woodstock. Shaped by decades of creating posters and sets for the stage and movies, von Arenburgâ€™s airline poster painting style evoked a similar drama and allure to his work in the entertainment industry.   See \"Artists of the Airways: Airline Travel Posters from the SFO Museum Collection\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library.
