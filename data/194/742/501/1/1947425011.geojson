        "body": "CALL FOR ARTISTS!  Are you a filmmaker? Interested in screening your film for an international audience? SFO Museum reviews exhibition proposals from artists and filmmakers on a rolling basis. Video Arts is currently programming four new films each month that are 20 minutes or less in duration. Due to our operation in a public space, Video Arts does not program work that features overt sexual or violent content. Those who are interested in participating may submit their work via our online form: https://bit.ly/3WlE0mV  The Video Arts Gallery is located pre-security in the Mayor Edwin M. Lee International Terminal Departures Hall and is open daily from 8:00am to 10:00pm. Learn more about this monthâ€™s films at: https://bit.ly/Video-Arts",
