        "body": "In 2013, Virgin Produced, a Virgin Group production company, created a new type of musical airline safety video for Virgin America that amused and entertained its passengers in a uniquely Virgin way. Directed by Jon M. Chu with music composed and performed by Todrick Hall and choreographed by Christopher Scott and Cyrus Spencer, the video featured Virgin America crew members, as well as professional actors, singers, and dancers. The first musical safety video of its kind, it went viral and was covered by media outlets across the country within moments of its debut online and on the airline’s flights. Forbes applauded the video as “a peppy tune, outstanding choreography, and a healthy dose of attitude… the video encapsulates Virgin's exuberant style and offers a clear distinction between itself and the staid safety messages of its competitors.\" The next year, the video won the Shorty Award for Best Use of Video in a Social Media Campaign. It set a new standard in safety videos for the airline industry, with numerous other carriers following Virgin America’s example and producing humorous and entertaining safety videos. https://bit.ly/4aS4Ibo  See \"VX Forever: The Legacy of Virgin America\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library.
