        "body": "“I try to supply fifty percent of the experience. The rest is up to the viewer.” —Mickey McGowan, April 1987  The Unknown Museum was conceived as a hands-on experience, encouraging visitors to physically interact with stacks and shelves full of items. Resident curator Mickey McGowan arranged his collection into domestically themed rooms. His intent with the museum was to challenge visitors with items they may have lived with and to suggest the impact of culture, advertising, and mass consumption on their lives.  A very special thank you to Mickey McGowan for making this exhibition possible. See “Recollections… from the Unknown Museum” on display, post-security, in Terminal 2 and online at: https://bit.ly/Unknown-Museum",
