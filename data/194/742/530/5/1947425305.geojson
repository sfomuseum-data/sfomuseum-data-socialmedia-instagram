        "body": "A visionary artist, Georges Liautaud (1899–1991) founded the Haitian metal sculpture movement. Liautaud worked as a blacksmith for several years repairing railways and in the 1940s, he opened a forge in his hometown of Croix-des-Bouquets where he fabricated mechanical parts, repaired items, and made crosses for cemeteries.  An encounter with U.S. painter DeWitt Peters (1902–66) in 1953, inspired Liautaud to explore metalworking as an artform. Using recycled oil drums, scraps of iron and iron chains, barbed wire, and other metals, and employing a hammer, anvil, chisel, and welding iron, he crafted sculptures embodying many themes—from spirits of the Haitian Vodou pantheon to whimsical figures of his imagination.
