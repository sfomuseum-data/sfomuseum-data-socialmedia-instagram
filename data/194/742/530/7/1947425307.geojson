        "body": "Choreographer Dwight Rhoden’s third work for San Francisco Ballet, \"The Promised Land,\" premiered as part of the 2022 Celebration, the Company’s first in-person season since the COVID-19 pandemic.   Rhoden has a distinctive choreographic style. Within Rhoden’s piece there is a range of textures, going from fast and chaotic to pensive and serene, paralleling the uncertainty of contemporary world events. While \"The Promised Land\" does not have a fixed story, there is a “wandering narrative” throughout inspired by circumstances of the past few years: the COVID-19 pandemic and the struggle for racial equality. But as Rhoden points out, his ballet is more about looking back and moving forward, or “how we recover.”   Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible. See “San Francisco Ballet at 90” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/SFBalletAt90",
