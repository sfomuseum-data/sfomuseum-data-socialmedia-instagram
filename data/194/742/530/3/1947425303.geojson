        "body": "𝘛𝘢𝘯𝘯𝘩ä𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘳 is the fifth opera by German composer Wilhelm Richard Wagner (1813–83) and was completed between 1843–45. San Francisco Opera first performed 𝘛𝘢𝘯𝘯𝘩ä𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘳 in 1930 at the Exposition Auditorium (now the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium). Four years later, 𝘛𝘢𝘯𝘯𝘩ä𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘳 was staged at the War Memorial Opera House with legendary Danish American tenor Lauritz Melchior (1890–1973) in the title role. Tannhäuser, Wagner’s lead character, is a minnesinger, or medieval German lyric poet, who is torn between lust for the goddess Venus and his former love Elisabeth. The two costumes on exhibition were worn by German tenor Peter Seiffert (b. 1954) during a 2007 San Francisco Opera production. The distressed version shows the wear that was incurred through the trials and tribulations of Tannhäuser during his penance to Rome and back. Both costumes feature lightweight, imitation chain mail that was custom-made in New Zealand.
