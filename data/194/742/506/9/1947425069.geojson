        "body": "In 2018, after eleven years of service, the airline ceased operations following its acquisition by Alaska Airlines. Many faithful customers were saddened to Virgin America go, yet the airline lives on within the collections of SFO Museum. Thanks to the numerous donations by former customers, Virgin America employees, and Alaska Airlines, the legacy of Virgin America will be preserved for future generations to research, explore, and celebrate. Moreover, many of Virgin Americaâ€™s innovations continue with Alaska Airlines and other carriers, reflecting their profound influence on the industry.   See \"VX Forever: The Legacy of Virgin America\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is located, pre-security, in the International Terminal and is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. https://ow.ly/efsY50R3KSv",
