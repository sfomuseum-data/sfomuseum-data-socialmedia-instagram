        "body": "Many ballet dancers customize their pointe shoes depending on their needs. Some find the right combination of fit, support, and suppleness in a shoe directly from the manufacturer, while other dancers special order their shoes from a specific maker. A dancer may alter their shoes once they receive them to make them fit perfectly. They often break the shank (the sole of the shoe that runs from toe to heel) or soften the box (the area around the toes that provides the dancer with the stability to be on pointe). Occasionally, a dancer will darn around the platform—the part of the shoe that the dancer balances on while on pointe—to help with stability or to make the shoe last longer. Sometimes, they rough up the bottom of the shoe to provide more traction. A dancer might also prepare their shoes differently depending on the ballet they are performing. If a role is particularly demanding, a dancer may use a brand-new pair of shoes for each performance—or each act!  Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
