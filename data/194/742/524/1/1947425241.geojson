        "body": "Our newest exhibition \"Kay Sekimachi: Weaving Traditions\" celebrates Kay Sekimachi, a pioneering Bay Area fiber artist. For more than seven decades, she has mastered a wide range of media and techniques, including on- and off-loom textiles, stitched-paper forms, and molded-fiber bowls. Considered a “weaver’s weaver,” Sekimachi has created an oeuvre of decorative, figurative, and abstract textile art and sculpture that is without parallel. This exhibition presents a retrospective of Kay Sekimachi’s extraordinary woven art from the collection of Forrest L. Merrill.  See \"Kay Sekimachi: Weaving Traditions\" on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. https://www.sfomuseum.org/exhibitions/kay-sekimachi-weaving",
