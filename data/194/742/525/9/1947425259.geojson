        "body": "Clara Barck Welles (1868–1965) founded the Kalo Shop in 1900 in Chicago. The Kalo Shop burgeoned into one of the most influential American handwrought silver manufacturers of the Arts and Crafts movement. Although Chicago metalsmiths made works by hand, they began with flat machine-rolled sheets of sterling silver. Avoiding this time-consuming, laborious step allowed them to apply their creative energy to producing forms, which were shaped using hand tools. Works display surfaces with visible, small hammer marks; these tiny facets reflect light, giving the surface a distinctive look and feel.  See \"A New Woman: Clara Barck Welles, Inspiration \u0026 Influence in Arts \u0026 Crafts Silver\" on display pre-security in the Mayor Edwin M. Lee International Terminal Departures Hall and online at: https://bit.ly/BarckWelles",
