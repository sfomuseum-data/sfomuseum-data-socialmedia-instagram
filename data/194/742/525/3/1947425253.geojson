There are not many objects in our collection that are still in use every day, except the original schedule board from SFO’s 1937 terminal building. The Aviation Museum and Library still uses the schedule board for its intended purpose, to announce current events at the airport. Pictured here is one of our fantastic volunteers, Bill, changing the schedule board for this month’s events at the Aviation Museum and Library. The schedule board is seen in the center of a 1941 photo of the airport terminal under the right-side staircase.  schedule board: San Francisco Airport; 1937 Transfer from San Francisco International Airport 1999.046.001",
