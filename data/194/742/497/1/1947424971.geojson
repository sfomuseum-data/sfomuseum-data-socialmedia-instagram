For instance, the shell of a drum may display carved human forms, while a sculptural figure adorns the handle of a bell or the top of a harp lute. Many forms have symbolic or spiritual significance; others are inspired entirely by their makerâ€™s imagination. Ornate instruments that play a role in royal, religious, or ceremonial functions are commonly made by experienced, revered craftspeople.   Special thank you to the Fowler Museum at UCLA for making this exhibition possible.
