        "body": "During the postwar era, Pan American World Airways expanded its services throughout the globe and replaced its flying boat fleet with the latest land-based airliners. Mexico City had been a Pan American destination since the early 1930s. After Mark von Arenburg flew there in the late 1940s, he created this dramatic Pan American poster. It features a Douglas DC-6 flying past the artist’s interpretation of an Aztec warrior figure, most likely inspired by reenactors on the Zócalo in Mexico City, and the sculpture of Quetzalcoatl from the Temple of the Feathered Serpent at Teotihuacan, and a woman selling pottery in a village. Mexico City’s Basilica of Santa María de Guadalupe can be seen in the distance, and the volcano Popocatépetl dominates in the background.   See \"Artists of the Airways: Airline Travel Posters from the SFO Museum Collection\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is located pre-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/AirwaysArtists",
