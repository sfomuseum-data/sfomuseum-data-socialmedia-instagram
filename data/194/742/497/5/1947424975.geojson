        "body": "Gabriel Bien-Aimé (b. 1951) grew up in Croix-des-Bouquets, the center of Haitian metal sculpture. Bien-Aimé worked as an auto mechanic for several years before apprenticing to sculptor Janvier Louisjuste. Bien-Aimé began gaining recognition for his work in the 1980s. He creates intricate cutwork with elaborate surface decoration in a whimsical fashion, rarely repeating the same imagery. His sculptures depict various animals and imaginative creatures, such as angels and horned figures, reflecting both Catholic and Vodou iconography, as well as themes inspired by the natural world. Bien-Aimé has relatives in the United States and lived in Boston from 1999 to 2015 when he returned to Haiti. Bien-Aime’s sculptures have been included in numerous international exhibitions. His works are in the permanent collections of the Musée du quai Branly in Paris as well as the Figge Art Museum in Davenport, Iowa, the Milwaukee Art Museum, Le Centre d’Art and the Musée d’Art Haïtien du Collège Saint-Pierre in Port-au-Prince.  See “The Enduring Spirit of Haitian Metal Sculpture” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/Haitian-Metal",
