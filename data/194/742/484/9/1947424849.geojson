        "body": "First flown in 1957, the Boeing 707 was the first successful jet airliner to provide regular, sustained commercial passenger service. The aircraft was developed by Boeing after a 1955 request from Pan American World Airways for a large-capacity, long-range, jet-powered airliner. Within its long, narrow fuselage the jetliner‚Äôs cabin had an initial capacity of up to 175 passengers. On its low, sweptback wings were mounted four turbojet engines that could power the airliner to cruising velocities approaching six hundred miles per hour. With its speed, reliability, large capacity, and reduced operating costs, the 707 revolutionized the airline industry and helped usher in the jet age of commercial aviation. Although primarily designed as a fast, long-haul transoceanic jetliner, the Boeing 707 was also purchased and leased by numerous U.S. carriers for their regional and transcontinental services. Continental Airlines‚Äô president Robert Six (1907‚Äì86) wanted Continental‚Äôs 707 airliner to be something unique. He conceived of the idea of painting the large vertical stabilizers gold and naming the airliners ‚ÄúGolden Jets.‚Äù He even had the name registered as a trademark. Continental ordered gold-toned hardware from Boeing for the bathrooms and had the seats upholstered in fabric of gold mixed with reds and warm blues. The airline‚Äôs stewardesses, then referred to as hostesses, marked the jetliner‚Äôs arrival dressed in newly designed uniforms.
