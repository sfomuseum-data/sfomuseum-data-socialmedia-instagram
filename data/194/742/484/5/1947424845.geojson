        "body": "David Klein (1918-2005) was a highly acclaimed American artist, most recognized for his TWA (Trans World Airlines) posters from the 1950s and â€˜60s. In the mid-1950s, Klein designed numerous travel posters for the airline, many of which are considered some of the best examples of airline art produced during the dawn of the commercial Jet Age. His use of modern abstract styles and vivid colors defined the medium of poster art for this period and beyond and won numerous awards for originality and excellence.   In the late 1950s, Klein produced a series that includes posters for San Francisco and New York. Klein was influenced by an art style known as Precisionism, which focused on industrial themes and used detailed, sharply defined geometrical lines and forms. In his vibrant San Francisco poster, he features a Boeing 707 jetliner flying over the Golden Gate Bridge with a ship entering the Golden Gate.
