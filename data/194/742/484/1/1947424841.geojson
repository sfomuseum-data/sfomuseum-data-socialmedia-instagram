He continued to create life-size figurative sculptures in plaster, bronze and marble over the succeeding decades. Neri said of his devotion to the figure: “I’ve always been intrigued with the spirit the figure conveys…It is the God-spirit that I think is the real God for us. It is the thing inside us that I want to talk about in the figure.”  See “Mujer Pegada, No. 4” by Manuel Neri on display, pre-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/4dZWsXV",
