        "body": "Ground crews and other support personnel were essential to keeping Virgin America‚Äôs operations running smoothly. Ramp agents/technicians performed many vital jobs for the airline in and around the aircraft, including guiding planes to and from their gates, loading and unloading baggage, operating baggage carts, de-icing aircraft, and many other airplane-servicing duties. These stylish, highly visible, and protective ramp technician coveralls were issued by Virgin America and were produced by the well-known work-clothes manufacturer Dickies. They feature durable black cotton-and-polyester-blend fabric with reflective safety striping on the arms, waist, legs, back, and shoulders, an embroidered Virgin America service mark on the upper left breast, embroidered ‚ÄúTech-OPS//Technician‚Äù with service mark on the shoulder, and four front and breast pockets with heavy-duty zipper closures.  See \"VX Forever: The Legacy of Virgin America\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is located, pre-security, in the International Terminal and is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. https://bit.ly/vx-forever  üì∏: Virgin America ramp technician uniform Dickies, Port Authority 2010 polyester, cotton, metal Collection of SFO Museum Coveralls: gift of Alaska Airlines Cap: gift of Sirena Lam 2018.083.049, 2019.032.068 L2023.1401.013, .014",
