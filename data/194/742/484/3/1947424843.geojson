        "body": "When Harold Bixby arrived in China in early 1933 on behalf of Pan American Airways, his main tasks were to expand the operations of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and to establish Pan American as a presence in the regional aviation community. Bixby was entering a challenging context unlike any he previously experienced in St. Louis. At this time, China had minimal infrastructure to support regular airline operations. Aircraft, airfields, and the trained personnel required to operate and maintain them were in short supply. China was fragmented politically with little central authority and foreign powers were aggressively carving out spheres of influence. CNAC, which had been founded by the Kuomintang government under Chairman Chiang Kai-shek based in Nanjing in 1930, operated a small fleet of aircraft that flew mail and limited numbers of passengers on select routes within the region. It was Bixby‚Äôs job to understand and expand CNAC‚Äôs operations and he regularly flew the entire system to familiarize himself with its personnel and equipment.  \"Unlocking an Archival Treasure: The Harold Bixby Collection‚Äù is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. Located pre-security in the International Terminal, the Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. https://bit.ly/Bixby-Collection  üì∏: photograph: Shanghai Bund; 1930s Collection of SFO Museum 2019.121.0107  photograph: CNAC (China National Aviation Corporation) offices; 1934 Collection of SFO Museum 2019.121.0101  photograph: peacetime shipment of serum from Shanghai; 1934 Collection of SFO Museum 2019.121.0092",
