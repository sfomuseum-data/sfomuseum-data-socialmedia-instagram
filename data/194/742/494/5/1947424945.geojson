        "body": "Zheng He (1371–1433), a Muslim court eunuch during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), was sponsored by the Yongle emperor to lead a fleet of ships on multiple expeditions to distant lands, including Southeast Asia. As a result, significant numbers of Chinese settled on the Malay Peninsula and as far as the Indonesian archipelago, over several centuries and married into local families. Their multiracial descendants are culturally referred to as Peranakan Chinese.    Nyonya or Peranakan porcelain, a richly decorated pastel porcelain, predominantly found on the Malay Peninsula, consists mostly of practical tableware, custom-ordered from Jingdezhen, China, by Peranakan families or businessmen in Southeast Asia during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Local importers also sold dinnerware to restaurants throughout most of the twentieth century. Nyonya has a distinct visual style—soft greens, reds, pinks, and yellows are skillfully used to create a sumptuous color contrast. Peonies and phoenixes are prominent; traditional patterns depicting flowers and birds also appear. Additional design motifs include botanical patterns and religious themes taken from Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam.   Special thank you to Sally Yu Leung and Guangzhen Zhou for making this exhibition possible, and to Dr. William Ma, Assistant Professor, College of Art \u0026 Design, Louisiana State University, for his curatorial contributions.
