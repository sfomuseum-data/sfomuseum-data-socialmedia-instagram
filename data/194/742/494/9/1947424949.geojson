As a non-traditional museum, we have to create everything from mounts, reproduction graphics, mannequins, backwall graphics and more at an off-site location, then set it up like a dress rehearsal for easy installation once it is time to install in the airport terminal gallery.   Our upcoming exhibition, “Rosie the Riveter: Womanpower in Wartime” opens soon. Stay tuned for more updates! https://bit.ly/4cxkM3h",
