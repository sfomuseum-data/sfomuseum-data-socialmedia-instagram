        "body": "Our newest exhibition, “Rosie the Riveter: Womanpower in Wartime” is now on display in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. Popular culture and propaganda launched the legend of “Rosie the Riveter,” the anonymous, bandanna-clad woman in coveralls who produced all manner of wartime equipment on the home front. An empowering icon of determination, Rosie the Riveter proved to a generation of Americans that women could excel in any job offered to them. More than sixteen million women were employed at the peak of wartime production in 1944—with over three million in skilled factory positions to support the massive increase in war-related industries.  A very special thank you to the National Park Service (@nationalparkservice), Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park (@rosietheriveternps), for making this exhibition possible, and to the Richmond Museum of History and Culture (@richmondcamuseum), and San Francisco State University, Labor Archives and Research Center (@sfstatelibrary).
