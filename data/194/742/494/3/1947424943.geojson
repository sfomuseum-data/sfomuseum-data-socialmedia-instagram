Von Arenburg created this dramatic, stage-like Australia and New Zealand poster featuring Sydney Harbour in the 1940s. It features many of the recognizable attractions of the New South Wales region, including a kookaburra sitting in a gum (eucalyptus) tree, inspired by the popular 1934 song, and an endearing koala with its baby. Pan Americanâ€™s latest Boeing 377 Stratocruiser airliner flies overhead.  See \"Artists of the Airways: Airline Travel Posters from the SFO Museum Collection\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library.
