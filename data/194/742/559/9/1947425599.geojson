        "body": "Born in Texas, Mance Lipscomb (1895–1976), the first artist Chris  Strachwitz released on his Arhoolie label, worked for decades as a  tenant farmer. Lipscomb referred to himself as a “songster;” his vast  repertoire included everything from blues to narrative ballads,  spirituals, popular songs, dance tunes, children’s songs, and work songs  dating from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. After recording  with Strachwitz, he became a pivotal figure on the folk music scene,  performing for audiences around the country.
