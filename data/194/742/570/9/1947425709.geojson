When cranked, the 20 butterflies continuously descend their belts at a rate dictated by the air resistance of their spinning iridescent wings.  Cranking faster than the descent rate of the butterflies causes them to rise towards the ceiling; cranking slower than this rate causes the butterflies to flutter back down or hover in one place.",
