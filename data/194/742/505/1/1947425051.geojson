        "body": "During the last half of the twentieth century, commercial aviation progressed at an unprecedented pace. Airlines rapidly expanded their services and updated their fleets with more advanced aircraft in order to attract customers and successfully contend within an increasingly competitive market. To promote these airliners, the airlines and manufacturers ran advertisements and published brochures that touted the new designs and amenities. They also contracted with aircraft model makers to create minutely detailed airliner models, including cutaway versions that revealed cabin interiors. On display at airports, within airline sales offices, and at travel agencies, models of airliners afforded prospective customers a unique three-dimensional view of the aircraft in which they could potentially fly.  See “A Cut Above: Airplane Models from the SFO Museum Collection” on display, pre-security, in the Mayor Edwin M. Lee International Terminal Departures Hall and online at: https://bit.ly/CutAboveModels",
