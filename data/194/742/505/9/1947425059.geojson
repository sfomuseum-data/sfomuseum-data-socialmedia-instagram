        "body": "During the 1960s, June Schwarcz pioneered electroforming, an innovative method that involved electroplating pieces made from thin copper foil. However, electroforming was unpredictable  and created dramatic surface detail, accentuating rims and edges with encrusted formations. Schwarcz incorporated a variety of finishes into her vessel forms, both inside and out. She layered vivid, multicolored enamels in multiple kiln firings, at times sandblasting the exterior to contrast with the interior.  A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible. See “June Schwarcz: Unconventional Enamels,” on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/UnconventionalEnamels",
