Assigned to China in early 1933, Bixby helped establish Pan Am’s profile and reputation in the region. He worked with the China National Aviation Corporation to lay the groundwork for the commercial success of Pan Am’s transpacific flying boat service. Pictured along Harold Bixby is Pan Am’s chief pilot, Captain Edwin C. Musick. Musick helped pioneer Pan Am's transpacific route on the China Clipper in 1935.   “Unlocking an Archival Treasure: The Harold Bixby Collection” is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library.
