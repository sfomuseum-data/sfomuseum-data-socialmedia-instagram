In our collection we have four examples of airline destination posters from Air Canadam Lufthansa, and Pan American that feature Neuschwanstein Castle. Located in Bavaria, the castle is visited by 1.3 million people a year. Built on the ruins of two previously demolished medieval castles, Ludwig II, King of Bavaria’s inspiration for Neuschwanstein were medieval culture, the operas of Richard Wagner, and another recently rebuilt castle, Wartburg Castle. The foundation of the castle was laid in 1869. The castle is said to be one of Walt Disney’s inspirations for Sleeping Beauty’s castle.   1. poster: Air Canada, Germany; 1980s Transfer from San Francisco International Airport 2012.129.006 https://bit.ly/4dhilSV  2. poster: Lufthansa; c. 1980 Gift of the William Hough Collection 2006.010.443 https://bit.ly/4de3x7M  3. poster: Lufthansa; 1978 Gift of Hans and Margret Steuck 2011.046.154 https://bit.ly/3waSgnW  4.poster: Pan American World Airways, Germany; early 1980s Gift of the Pan Am Association 2000.058.0277 https://bit.ly/3Uj1iXX",
