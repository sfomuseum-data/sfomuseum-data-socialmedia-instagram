        "body": "It is your last week to see \"Kay Sekimachi: Weaving Traditions!\" Fiber artist, Kay Sekimachi, considered a “weaver’s weaver,” has created an oeuvre of decorative, figurative, and abstract textile art and sculpture that is without parallel.   \"I use traditional tapestry techniques modified for my own personal needs. Rather than working in rigid color areas and interlocking weft, I try for a more fluid effect by [using] extra weft inserts and overlapping threads. This enables me to work more rapidly and improvise as the work progresses. In each tapestry I try to achieve a harmonious integration of design, material, and technique.\" —Kay Sekimachi, 1959   Sekimachi began to weave more abstract wall hangings in the late 1950s, along with large, semi-transparent room dividers for the open floor plan homes popular at the time. Sekimachi recalled the complex process of creating “Room Divider” shown here: “I tied the warp off in groups of five threads, knowing that the groups of threads would have to be shifted in order to make the ikat pattern that I wanted....When the warp came out of the dye bath and dried, I cut away the wrapping and the warp was five inches of black, alternating with five inches of natural…Then the warp was spread in the raddle [a wooden bar with pegs that maintains thread spacing], and the warp threads shifted to make the pattern that I wanted. It was a lot of work.”  A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible.
