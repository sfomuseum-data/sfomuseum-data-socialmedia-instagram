        "body": "The Boeing 747SP (Special Performance) took off on its maiden flight on July 4, 1975. Featuring a shorter fuselage, the 747SP was introduced by Pan American in 1976. Pan American specifically requested the 747SP as it offered longer range, increased speed, and was capable of using shorter runways. Two record-breaking inaugural flights marked the first use of Pan Am's new Boeing B747SP (Special Performance) jetliner on April 25 and 26, 1976. At the time of production, it had the longest range of any commercial aircraft, able to fly non-stop from New York to Tokyo - a distance of 6,916 miles - in 13 hours, 40 minutes.  photograph: Pan American World Airways, Boeing 747SP; c. 1976 Gift of the Estate of Fred Nott 2004.016.120.010",
