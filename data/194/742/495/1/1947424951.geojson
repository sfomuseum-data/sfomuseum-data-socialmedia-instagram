It was an advanced, large-capacity propliner featuring a unique, aerodynamic, dolphin-shaped fuselage with a distinctive triple tail. Introduced in 1951, the TWA (Trans World Airlines) Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation was a larger, long-range upgrade of the Constellation. The L-1049G Super Constellation was introduced four years later. It was designed for even longer-range flights and included wingtip tanks for extra fuel, radar equipment, and more powerful engines. Promoted by TWA as the ‚ÄúSuper G,‚Äù the airline touted its technology, speed, exceptional comfort, and smooth flying characteristics. The airliner could accommodate between sixty-two and ninety-five passengers depending on the class configuration. During the mid-1950s, the Super G served as TWA‚Äôs premier long-distance transoceanic airliner on routes to Europe and beyond.
