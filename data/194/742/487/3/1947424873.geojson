        "body": "In 1942, the United States War Production Board, War Advertising Council, and Office of War Information coordinated a nationwide campaign to recruit women into the workforce. Propaganda recast traditional female roles and publicized women as vital to the success of an industrial nation at war. A barrage of posters, photographs, and advertisements featured women working in positions that were previously reserved for men. Content was designed to attract new workers and to convince men that female participation was temporary and necessary. Glamorized images reassured new recruits that their femininity would not be sacrificed by taking wartime work. Although women from all walks of life proved invaluable to the war effort, racial prejudice excluded women of color from government posters and only featured them in propaganda photographs.
