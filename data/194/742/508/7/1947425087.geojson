        "body": "June Schwarcz made unconventional enameled art, pioneering an art form called electroforming, an innovative method that involved electroplating pieces made from thin copper foil. After finalizing a pattern in paper, Schwarcz crafted the shape from thin copper foil by cutting, folding, gathering, and stitching with copper wire—almost treating the material like fabric. Schwarcz then submerged the form in her electroplating tank, which deposited a layer of metal that strengthened the vessel. In later years, Schwarcz substituted copper screen for foil, drawn to the screen for its lighter weight and fabric-like qualities.   A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible. See “June Schwarcz: Unconventional Enamels,” on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/UnconventionalEnamels",
