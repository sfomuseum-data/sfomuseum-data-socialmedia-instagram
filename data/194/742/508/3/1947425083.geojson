        "body": "Fiber artist Kay Sekimachi’s series of monofilament sculptures began in 1963 as an experiment to weave a wall hanging in multiple, translucent layers. After weaving a linen sample, Sekimachi realized she could produce three-dimensional forms using a nylon monofilament material (now commonly known as fishing line) that DuPont introduced in 1959. Sekimachi wove her monofilament sculptures as flat, interlocking layers that when suspended, folded-out into stratified, cascading shapes—suggesting billowing, organic forms that she named after natural phenomena. “Ogawa” translates from Japanese to “little river” or “stream.   A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible.
