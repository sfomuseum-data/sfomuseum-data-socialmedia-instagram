Started by the National Museum of Women in the Arts (@womeninthearts), #5WomenArtists calls attention to the fact that women are underrepresented in the art world and that many people can’t name even five female artists.  Alicia McCarthy is a key member of the Mission School, a movement that emerged in the 1990’s in San Francisco and drew inspiration from graffiti, street art, and the use of non-traditional materials.  In creating “MMXX,” McCarthy worked closely with Lineman Architectural Glass in Oakland to translate her distinctive aesthetics of repetition, variation, and chance into glass using a combination of techniques.  By painting, airbrushing, and sandblasting the different surfaces of the artwork’s layered assembly, she adds depth and dimension to the work’s radiating design.  See “MMXX” by Alicia McCarthy on display, post-security in the International Terminal. https://ow.ly/fyse50QNaN0",
