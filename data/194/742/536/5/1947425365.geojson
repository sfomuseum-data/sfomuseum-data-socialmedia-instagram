The exposed area reveals a complex, multi-faceted interiority that contrasts with the highly polished, smooth surface.  See “Cilindro Costruito” by Arnaldo Pomodoro on display, in the pre-security connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, right under SFO’s air traffic control tower. https://bit.ly/3CvSTrC",
