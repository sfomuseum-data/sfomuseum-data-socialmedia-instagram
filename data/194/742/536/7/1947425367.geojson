The first commercial airliner to have a pressurized cabin, the aircraft was named the Stratoliner for its ability to cruise near the stratosphere at an altitude of over 30,000 feet. This 1940s postcard shows a weather chart with various types of clouds and the weather they typically carry, with the Stratoliner flying smoothly above. Only ten of the airliners were produced: one prototype, five for TWA, three for Pan American, and one for Howard Hughes.   postcard: Pan American Airways, weather chart, Boeing 307 Stratoliner; 1940s Gift of Jon E.
