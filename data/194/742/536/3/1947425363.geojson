With herself as the subject, the artist uses a rich mix of images, graphics, and typography to explore how the relationships between organic beings and artificial beings are constructed, deconstructed, and reconstructed in digital environments. In the first pair, “Persona_1” and “Persona_2,” Cai conveys the idea that the digital realm has gradually created “a world mix of humans and algorithms, physical and virtual.” “Persona_1” represents the artist. A virtual gaming character, with a name, age, job, and friends, appears in “Persona_2.”   \"Constitution\" by Celia Ziyan Cai is on display, pre-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. http://bit.ly/3IRNz4I",
