        "body": "Developed by the Lockheed Corporation, the L-188 Electra was the only large turboprop airliner produced in the U.S. It featured four Allison 501-D13 turboprop engines (a revolutionary power plant consisting of a jet turbine engine powering a propeller through a gearbox) mounted on short-span, low-mounted wings. The prototype flew in 1957, and that same year initial deliveries went to American and Eastern Air Lines. With the subsequent introduction of faster turbojets, the Electra was relegated to regional carriers such as Western Airlines. During the postwar era, Western Airlines quickly grew as a regional airline serving routes from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to the West Coast. With medium range, a cruise speed of nearly four hundred miles per hour, and a capacity of up to one hundred passengers, the Electra was ideal for Western‚Äôs needs and was instrumental in attracting a sizable customer base. The aircraft‚Äôs interior was designed by the firm of Henry Dreyfuss with blue and turquoise seats and curtains, blue pile carpet, and overhead panels in ‚Äúrestful neutral tones.‚Äù The lounge in the aft section of the cabin featured wraparound, sofa-style seating and a large mural of North America showing the airline‚Äôs route system. Western promoted its Electra airliners as a new standard in ‚ÄúJet-Age Comfort,‚Äù with wide aisles, roomy seats, advanced air conditioning and heating, and an interior decor that offered ‚Äúa new high in travel luxury.‚Äù   See ‚ÄúA Cut Above: Airplane Models from the SFO Museum Collection‚Äù on display, pre-security, in the Mayor Edwin M.
