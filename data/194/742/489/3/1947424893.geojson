        "body": "During its first year of operations, Virgin America flew to only eight cities. Over the next decade, the airline steadily grew and expanded its route system to ultimately include thirty-one destinations. In 2017, to celebrate its extensive growth, the airline offered first-class passengers—and as a buy-onboard item for other passengers—amenity kits with cheeky characters and destination-themed illustrations. The series was inspired by the popular characters used in Virgin America’s online booking system. The “City Pods” collection was designed by Alex Silva, Director of WESSCO’s Los Angeles Creative Studio. To convey Virgin America’s fun and light-hearted personality, the designs humorously incorporated iconic places and activities across twenty-four destination-city themes. They included a pizza-eating Statue of Liberty in New York, celebrities on a Hollywood red carpet in Los Angeles, a cowboy riding a mechanical bull in Dallas, a mobster and a showgirl in Las Vegas, and President Barack Obama taking a selfie with Secret Service agents in Washington, DC. Each City Pods amenity kit came with a sleep mask and a ballpoint pen.  See \"VX Forever: The Legacy of Virgin America\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is located, pre-security, in the International Terminal and is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. https://bit.ly/vx-forever",
