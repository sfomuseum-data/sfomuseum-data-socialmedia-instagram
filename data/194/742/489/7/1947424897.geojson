        "body": "Porcelain developed in China during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and continued to be refined in proceeding centuries. Made with kaolin clay and other additives and fired at extremely high temperatures (above 1260 degrees Celsius or 2300 degrees Fahrenheit), porcelain results in a translucent, milky, white glass-like surface. Though porcelain was made throughout China, the kilns at Jingdezhen, located in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, perfected the art of porcelain painted with cobalt-blue decoration during the fourteenth century. The blue color came from cobalt oxide, which was initially imported from the Middle East. Exceptional artisans carefully hand painted designs onto porcelain using a brush. Long admired throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, Chinese blue-and-white porcelain was highly sought after for its beauty, durability, and pure-white color and widely exported beginning in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).   Special thank you to Sally Yu Leung and Guangzhen Zhou for making this exhibition possible, and to Dr. William Ma, Assistant Professor, College of Art \u0026 Design, Louisiana State University, for his curatorial contributions.
