        "body": "Building on the success of her loom-woven sculptures, in the 1970s Kay Sekimachi adapted nylon monofilament to the centuries-old, off-loom technique of card weaving. Sekimachi created a series of hanging sculptures that she named “River,” stating, “I thought of them as rivers because they were narrow and long and sometimes the warp threads were twisted and sort of hung free, and then they came together again.” To weave such long and complex shapes off the loom, Sekimachi employed a six-foot-long, cribbage-like board made by her husband, the master woodturner Bob Stocksdale (1913–2003), that could accommodate up to 400 warp threads and 100 cards. With her preference to focus on one media and technique at a time, Sekimachi then substituted linen for monofilament and created the Marugawa series of card-woven tubes, naming them for a Japanese word that translates to “round river.”   A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible. See \"Kay Sekimachi: Weaving Traditions\" on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 or online at: https://bit.ly/WeavingT",
