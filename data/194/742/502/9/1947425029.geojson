The work transforms as images of earth, sea and various graphics give way to a gradient of translucent whites, revealing what the artist envisioned as “a cloud of kites, and a landscape of air and earth, painted at the edge of the sky.” The work creates the impression of a landscape drifting in and out of visibility through clouds, or slowly becoming subsumed by a descending marine layer. Other references include video games, virtual environments, cosmology, systems and languages of representation, nature, art, technology and architecture.  See “This Infinite Gateway of Time and Circumstance” by Jacob Hashimoto, pre-security, above the Quail + Crane restaurant in the Grand Hyatt at SFO and online at: https://qr.sfomuseum.org/44EQd8t",
