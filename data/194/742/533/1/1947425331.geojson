The donor, Michael Hanson, was the child of Barbara Hanson and Pan American Captain Alvin “Tip” Hanson. Captain Hanson worked for Pan American from 1965 until its demise in 1991. Before the airline’s Berlin-based employees departed, Barbara Hanson wanted to remember the fun times and friends she had made or reunited with during her time at the base. She drew an outline of Berlin, the Wall, and many of the places the employees frequented. The canvas was brought along to the many “base closing parties” to be signed by Pan Am’s community members.",
