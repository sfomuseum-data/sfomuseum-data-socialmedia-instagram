And after all, that's what this is all about. It's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power — it's about giving those young people out there in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias, hope. You gotta give them hope.”  Harvey Bernard Milk (1930–78) was a visionary human rights leader, a groundbreaking political luminary, and a seminal figure of the LGBTQ rights movement. Due to his high public profile as the first openly gay elected official in California, Milk attracted a torrent of hate mail, including threats on his life. In a chilling forecast, Milk recorded a living will on November 18, 1978, proclaiming, “If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.” Milk was assassinated shortly after, 45 years ago today, on November 27, 1978.  In June 2020, SFO Museum presented “My Name is Harvey Milk,” a film by Leo Herrera. A haunting elegy featuring an excerpt of the audio will Harvey Milk recorded in the event of his assassination, the suit he wore on the day of his murder in 1978 provides a poignant background image.  https://www.sfomuseum.org/video-arts/my-name-harvey-milk",
