        "body": "This model of the Continental Air Lines Douglas DC-7B City of Los Angeles was crafted by Gary Field (b. 1956) using fabrication methods similar to those of premier airliner model makers of the 1950s. He initially learned mold making and foundry skills at public schools in Los Angeles where he grew up in the 1960s and ‘70s. Field crafted a number of airliner models (three of which are in this exhibition) as mementos for his father who had a distinguished career as pilot for Continental, retiring as a captain. Following his father’s lead, Field also initially worked for the airlines in maintenance until the demand for his craft enabled him to pursue model making as a full-time occupation. To create metal models such as this he first carved a positive form in wood based on aircraft plans. From this form he created a mold to cast the model in metal, usually aluminum. In cutaway models he left portions of the fuselage open to insert the interior and add plastic viewing windows. In this model he endeavored to create a highly accurate interior based on the original Continental DC-7B cabin details and amenities, with seats, luggage racks, lavatories, a galley, passengers, and Continental’s signature Coach Lounge all individually cast in plastic.

Lee International Terminal Departures Hall and online at: https://bit.ly/CutAboveModels",
