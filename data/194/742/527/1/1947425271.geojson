        "body": "In October 1951, the airport held a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Central Terminal (now Terminal 2). Designed in the International Style, the seven-story building employed an innovative, dual-level layout that separated departures from arrivals. Dedicated roadways streamlined traffic to the terminal, and passenger entryways on both levels were fitted with hands-free, automatic doors—an exciting new invention at the time. Panoramic views of the airfield and San Francisco Bay were provided from multiple spectators’ terraces and the International Room restaurant.  Learn more about SFO’s Central Terminal in “The 1954 San Francisco International Airport Terminal” on display in the SkyTerrace.   The SkyTerrace is located pre-security in Terminal 2 and is open Friday to Monday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  http://bit.ly/32ooxEQ  negative: San Francisco Airport, Terminal Building construction; 1953 Transfer from San Francisco International Airport 2011.032.0337",
