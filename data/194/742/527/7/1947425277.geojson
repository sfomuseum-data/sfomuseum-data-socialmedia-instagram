        "body": "Our newest exhibition “Unlocking an Archival Treasure: The Harold Bixby Collection” is a two-part exhibition containing selections from The Harold Bixby Collection of over six hundred letters and documents and roughly five hundred photographic prints and negatives collected throughout his career. A midwestern businessman, Bixby’s strong interest in the emerging technology of aviation led to a career that encompassed some of the most important milestones in air travel of the 1920s and 30s. Bixby joined Pan American Airways in 1933 and worked for the airline for the rest of his career, retiring in 1955. Bixby managed the airline’s interests in Asia, particularly PAA’s partnership in the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and the opening of transpacific flying boat service in the 1930s.  “Unlocking an Archival Treasure: The Harold Bixby Collection” is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. Located pre-security in the International Terminal, the Aviation Museum and Library is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. https://www.sfomuseum.org/exhibitions/harold-bixby-collection",
