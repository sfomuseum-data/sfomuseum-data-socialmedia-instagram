        "body": "By October 1928, all four hangars located at Mills Field were finished. Hangar No. 1 was the first aircraft hangar at Mills Field, located 150 feet to the south of the first administration building built in 1927. Three additional hangars, finished the next year, were built next to Hangar No. 1. In the first three years of the airport’s operation, the location at Mills Field was still experimental and not permanently secured. To allow for disassembly and relocation, central attach points for the hangars’ steel frame were fastened with nuts and bolts rather than rivets. Lettering on the roof of Hangar No. 1 identified the airport from above, while an illuminated wind vane, rotating beacon, and an arrow pointing north provided weather and navigational information to approaching pilots. Although the four hangars were conceived as temporary structures, Hangar No. 4 stood until 1999.   Learn more about the development of San Francisco International Airport in “Mills Field and the San Francisco Airport” on display in the SkyTerrace.   The SkyTerrace is located pre-security in Terminal 2 and is open Friday to Monday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  http://bit.ly/32ooxEQ",
