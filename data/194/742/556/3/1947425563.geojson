        "body": "A unique form of gospel music, Sacred Steel features lap and pedal steel guitars. It developed in the 1930s by members of the House of God, a Holiness/Pentecostal church. Music serves as an integral part of their church services. The music is typically marked by spontaneous singing, clapping, dancing, and shout-outs. Robert Stone, a Florida folklorist, made the first compilation recording on cassette in the early 1990s. Upon hearing it, Chris Strachwitz released the recordings on CD and later dove further into the evocative musical genre, recording talented performers such as The Campbell Brothers and Aubrey Ghent. Strachwitz also helped produce the documentary Sacred Steel, which visits several churches, tracing the development of this compelling genre. Previously these talented players were largely unknown outside of the church; but groups such as The Campbell Brothers, Robert Randolph, and The Lee Boys now tour and perform for secular audiences at various venues. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
