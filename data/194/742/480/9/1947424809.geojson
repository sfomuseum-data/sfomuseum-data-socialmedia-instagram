        "body": "Transportes AÃ©reos Portugueses (TAP), the flag carrier of Portugal, was founded on March 14, 1945. As with many post-WWII airlines, TAP began with two repurposed military Douglas DC-3s, which were adapted to civilian use. On September 19, the same year, TAP embarked on their first domestic service from Lisbon to Madrid. With the delivery of its 100th aircraft, an Airbus A330neo, TAP began service to San Francisco on June 10, 2019. This poster for promoted travel to Portugal, known for their port wine, which is protected under the European Union Protected Designation of Origin guidelines.
