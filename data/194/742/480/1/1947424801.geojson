Soriano, a Spanish Filipino businessman, was president of the San Miguel brewery and loaned his personal Beech 18 for PAL's conception. By 1948, PAL was flying Douglas DC-6s from Manila to SFO via Guam, Wake Island, and Honolulu, a similar route to the one used by the Pan American Airwaysâ€™ transpacific Clipper flying boats during the late 1930s and early â€˜40s.
