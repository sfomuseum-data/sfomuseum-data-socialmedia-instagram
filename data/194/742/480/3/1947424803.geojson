        "body": "During the Second World War, millions of women were introduced to working two shifts‚Äîone on the job, and the other at home. Rationing, childcare, and overcrowding added to the strain of long shifts, extended workweeks, and round-the-clock production schedules. For those who served dual roles before the war, defense industry work suggested a brighter future. Countless women formed career aspirations, Phyllis Gould, a welder at the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond, California, remarked of her wartime experience, ‚Äúfrom that point on I always thought I can do anything I want to do. If I set my mind to it, I can do anything. And that's how I've lived the rest of my life.‚Äù   A very special thank you to the National Park Service, Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park, for making this exhibition possible, and to the Richmond Museum of History and Culture, and San Francisco State University, Labor Archives and Research Center.
