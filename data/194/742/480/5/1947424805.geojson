        "body": "In 1869, Andrew Hallidie (1836‚Äì1900) observed passenger-carrying horses struggling on wet cobblestones as they made the trek up San Francisco‚Äôs Jackson Street. As a result, Hallidie created a steam-engine-powered, wire-cable driven rail system to take passengers up the city‚Äôs steep hills. His father, an inventor, had patented the ‚Äúwire rope‚Äù cable in Britain that Hallidie employed in his cable cars. Hallidie tested his first car in August of 1873, and his Clay Street Hill Railroad began public service in September. In the late 1870s and ‚Äô80s, several competing cable car lines emerged. The 1906 earthquake and fires reduced many of the rail lines to rubble. Most cars on the California Street line burned. Many of the Market Street cable cars operating west of Van Ness Avenue that survived the earthquake were converted to temporary housing.
