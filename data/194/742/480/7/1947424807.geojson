Introduced to California during Spanish occupation, tile remained a central decorative element in the early twentieth century. The finest tiles produced in California from the 1910s–40s stand as a testament to the state’s rich architectural history. This exhibition features decorative California tile by Los Angeles and Bay Area companies from the collection of the Tile Heritage Foundation.
