Feinstein was the mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988. During her time as mayor, she was committed to making SFO a world-class facility and was an early supporter of SFO Museum. In an oral history recorded in 1989, she recounts, “I knew we had something one day when my mother-in-law said she was taking a friend and went out to see the Corning glass exhibit and have lunch at the airport. All of us just want to just leave the airport. Then I began to think that there was something and I've followed those shows and I think they have just been extraordinary.”  photograph: San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Eastern Air Lines; c. 1980 Transfer from San Francisco International Airport 1997.52.083.068 https://collection.sfomuseum.org/objects/1762889489/",
