        "body": "Fiber artist Kay Sekimachi (b. 1926) experimented with textiles as an artform after attending a lecture in 1951 by master weaver Trude Guermonprez (1910–76). In 1963, she began weaving multilayered monofilament sculptures that elevated her status as an artist. During the 1970s, Sekimachi created innovative, off-loom sculptures before starting a series of intricate, loom-woven books and boxes. Sekimachi was a prolific maker of paper bowls and other forms in the 1980s–90s; however, she continued weaving, fascinated by the challenges of the loom and drawing inspiration from her Japanese heritage.   A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible.
