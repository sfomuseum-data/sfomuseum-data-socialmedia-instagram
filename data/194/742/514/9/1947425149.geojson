        "body": "In an era of digital technology and one-click ease, John Chiara prefers a complex, analog approach to making photographs. The artist designs and builds large-format cameras by hand and tows his gear on a flatbed trailer from place to place. Making photographs in this way takes great physical effort, patience, and forethought but results in luminescent and evocative images.  Landscapes are a favorite subject for Chiara. In this work, he captures an idyllic waterfront view along the Northern California coastline.  See “Cabrillo Highway at Pescadero Creek Road, Variation 4” by John Chiara on display, pre-security, on level 2 of the Grand Hyatt Hotel. https://www.sfomuseum.org/public-art/public-collection/cabrillo-highway-pescadero-creek-road-variation-4",
