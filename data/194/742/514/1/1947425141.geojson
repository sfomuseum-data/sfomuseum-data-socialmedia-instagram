        "body": "Introduced in 1955, the Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation, also known as the “Super G,” was a longer-range upgrade variant of the Super Constellation. Equipped with wingtip fuel tanks, it was primarily designed for operation on transatlantic routes. It was followed in 1957 by the improved L-1649 Starliner, the final version of the Constellation. Passengers flying between the U.S. and Europe could expect to spend many long hours sitting in the cabins of these propliners. Cruising at around 300 miles per hour, a flight with refueling stops between London and Los Angeles could require more than twenty hours. Henry Dreyfuss Associates designed the cabin interiors for these Lockheed airliners in a multitude of harmonized color and fabric combinations. In order to minimize the claustrophobic effects of viewing down a long tube they divided it into four separate sections, which included a roomy first class lounge.
