        "body": "The Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band has performed together since 1977. Marc Savoy (b. 1940) lives in Eunice, Louisiana. He began to play the accordion at the age of twelve with an instrument he made himself. In the early 1960s, he opened a music store and began building accordions for sale. His wife Ann (b. 1952) performs in the band as a singer and guitarist; she is also a Cajun music historian and author. Michael Doucet (b. 1951), the bandâ€™s fiddler, grew up surrounded by traditional music in southwest Louisiana. In the 1970s, he obtained a grant to study with and document master fiddlers of the region and learned to play music from the best Cajun and Creole musicians. Both the Savoys and Michael Doucet have played important roles in the preservation and revitalization of Cajun music and culture. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
