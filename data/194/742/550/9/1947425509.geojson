        "body": "Clifton Chenier (1925–87), considered the “King of Zydeco,” invented and popularized the musical genre to audiences nationwide as well as in Europe. Chenier’s father, a farmer, played music on the accordion at Creole dances. Rather than use the traditional button accordion typical in Cajun and Creole music, Chenier played a piano accordion, which can play in any key. In 1976, Arhoolie released Chenier’s “Bogalusa Boogie,” his seventh and most famous album. Chenier was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Hall of Fame in 2011, and received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2014. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
