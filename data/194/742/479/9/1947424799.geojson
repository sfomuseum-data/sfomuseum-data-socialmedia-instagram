        "body": "Students of the photography program at the California College of the Arts (CCA) created the works in “Here and Home.” Photographs, which are passed down through generations, play an important role in how family members tell their stories. The student work in this exhibition follows in this legacy. Some of these photographers depict their families’ place of birth or where they grew up. Others depict their “chosen families” of friends and fellow artists that they met while living in San Francisco. The images encourage viewers to think about what “Here and Home” mean to us all.  A very special thank you to California College of the Arts instructors Aspen Mays and Nelson Chan for making this exhibition possible. See “Here and Home: Contemporary Photography by Students of the Photography Program at the California College of the Arts,” on display, pre-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/4hUwXtS",
