        "body": "Murat Brièrre (1938–88) was the first to study under visionary artist Georges Liautaud (1899–1991), and he quickly gained recognition as one of the preeminent metal sculptors of Haiti. Brièrre premiered new themes, such as sunbursts with facial expressions and pregnant women carrying babies in their bellies. Fantastical creatures and figures linked together to form narratives comprise some of his highly imaginative, distinctive work. Like other Haitian artists, much of his sculpture displays elements of Haitian Vodou.   See “The Enduring Spirit of Haitian Metal Sculpture” on display, pre-security, in the Mayor Edwin M. Lee International Terminal Departures Hall and online at: https://ow.ly/colB50QIZUG",
