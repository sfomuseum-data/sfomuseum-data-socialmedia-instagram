Our poster collection, comprised of over one thousand posters, demonstrates the breadth and the width of airline posters across the 20th century. Used to promote airline destinations in ticket offices, travel agencies, and airports, travel posters were typically flashy and eye catching, advertising the destination's most notable tourist attractions.   One noteworthy airline poster in our collection, showcasing San Francisco and our many hills, is this United Air Lines poster from the 1950s. This scene looking down California Street, highlights many iconic San Francisco landmarks including the distinctive Sing Fat and Sing Chong buildings, the Bay Bridge, and cable cars. A Douglas DC-6B flies across the sky advertising United service.    Have you ever ridden on a cable car?  poster: United Air Lines, San Francisco; 1951 Purchase 1994.09.02 https://ow.ly/1qep50QEkWi",
