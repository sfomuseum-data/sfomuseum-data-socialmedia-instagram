Founded as the San Francisco Opera Ballet in 1933, San Francisco Ballet is the oldest professional ballet company in the United States. This exhibition features costumes from ballets created by choreographers who were commissioned for five choreographic festivals under artistic director Helgi Tomasson during his 37-year tenure, showing the breadth of repertoire and design created in San Francisco.
