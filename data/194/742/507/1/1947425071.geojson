He arranged toys and other common mid-century objects in chrome-plated aquariums from the same era; only a typewritten notecard offered a title or brief explanation. Other items were displayed in “specimen jars” with simple, descriptive labels.  A very special thank you to Mickey McGowan for making this exhibition possible. See “Recollections… from the Unknown Museum” on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. https://ow.ly/oRgR50R75QA",
