        "body": "Introduced in 1964, the Boeing 727 was a medium-range jetliner with intermediate capacity designed to serve regional airports with shorter runways. Beginning in the early 1970s, PSA offered Boeing 727 interiors in peach, pink, and magenta, similar to the colors featured on their liveries at the time. This three-seat coach section was manufactured by Boeing for installation in the 727 airliner in the 1960s. It was upholstered in the 1970s by PSA in an intricate floral pattern fabric inspired by the countercultural, flower-power designs of the era. The armrests are covered in solid peach vinyl, while the headrests are protected with slip-over covers that alternate between peach and pink. The frame and the legs of the seating section are constructed of heavy duty aluminum. Each seat includes moderate foam cushioning with a pushbutton-activated recline mechanism and ashtrays in the armrests. Fold-out tray tables were installed in the seatbacks. Now ubiquitous, this was a new, space saving convenience at the time. Prior to this innovation, trays were usually attached at the front of the seat for meals and were removed after the service.   ðŸ“¸:  coach seat section: Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), Boeing 727 cabin interior; 1970s Gift of Chris and Leacy Laborde 2021.057.010 https://bit.ly/4bOxhqB  Braniff International Boeing 727 interior early 1970s  paper, ink Collection of SFO Museum  Gift of Thomas G.
