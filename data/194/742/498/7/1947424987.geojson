When confronted with so many common objects from years past, visitors often asked curator, Mickey McGowan, to see a specific item, and then proceeded to search for it among a multitude of similar things. The process evoked familiarity, comfort, and was thought-provoking. McGowan recalled a “special kind of laughter” heard from visitors, “not like you hear at comedy shows, but more like some incredible kind of therapeutic release, which was laughter but also joy and reminiscence–a rekindling.” These personal connections are the “secrets” behind the Unknown Museum.  A very special thank you to Mickey McGowan for making this exhibition possible. See “Recollections… from the Unknown Museum” on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. https://bit.ly/Unknown-Museum",
