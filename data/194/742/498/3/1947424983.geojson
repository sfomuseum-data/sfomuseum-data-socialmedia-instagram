        "body": "Throughout the eleven years of its operation, Virgin America supported the LGBTQ community and remained committed to LGBTQ rights and equality. During this time, the carrier served as the official airline sponsor of the San Francisco Pride Parade. Virgin America consistently received top scores in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index, which rates workplaces on their policies and practices related to LGBTQ employees. The airline also supported Bay Area non-profit LGBTQ organizations through San Francisco Pride's Community Partners program. This “Change is in the Air” poster was produced by Virgin America for the San Francisco Pride Parade to champion LGBTQ rights with an ascending Airbus A320 in rainbow colors, symbolizing LGBTQ pride and solidarity.\t  See \"VX Forever: The Legacy of Virgin America\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is located, pre-security, in the International Terminal and is open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. https://bit.ly/vx-forever",
