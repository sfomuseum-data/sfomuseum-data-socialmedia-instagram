        "body": "The fearless lion motif was introduced to China alongside Buddhism where it symbolizes strength and protection. Lions also signify harmony, blessings, and high military rank. The lion appears frequently in Chinese decorative arts; highly stylized, it bears only a faint resemblance to the real animal. The Chinese word for “lion” can be a pun for “generations” (shi), “master” (shi), and “thoughts” (si), all pronounced the same way. Because they are powerful creatures, guardian lions (“foo dogs”) guard the entrances to temples and public buildings. Today, they can even be found outside of restaurants and hotels in both China and other places around the world where Chinese have emigrated. Created in pairs from stone, bronze, or ceramic, the male plays with a brocaded ball and the female tames a cub under her left paw. The male is usually placed to the left of the doorway and the female to the right. Singular or pairs of lions may also appear nearby the entrances to homes where they provide protection to their owners.  Special thank you to Sally Yu Leung and Guangzhen Zhou for making this exhibition possible, and to Dr. William Ma, Assistant Professor, College of Art \u0026 Design, Louisiana State University, for his curatorial contributions.
