With SFO (San Francisco International Airport) serving as its airport home base, the carrier operated a fleet of narrow-body, medium-to-long-range Airbus airliners on routes across the U.S. with a focus on major coastal cities, as well as Dallas, Las Vegas, Denver, Chicago, and destinations in Hawai’i and Mexico. At its peak, Virgin America flew to thirty-one destinations. Throughout the period of its operations, the airline earned a multitude of industry and consumer awards including the Condé Nast Readers' Choice Award and Travel + Leisure Top Domestic Airline for ten consecutive years.
