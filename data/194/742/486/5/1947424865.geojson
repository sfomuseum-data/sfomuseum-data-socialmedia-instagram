        "body": "Our newest exhibition, “San Francisco: City of the World” is now on display in Terminal 2!  San Francisco, the ancestral, current, and future homeland of the Ramaytush Ohlone people, was founded in 1776 as a presidio and mission during Spanish occupation. In 1846, around one thousand people, lived in the city. In 1848, gold was discovered in the Sierra Nevada foothills. The Gold Rush transformed the region into a bustling city of approximately twenty-five thousand inhabitants. San Francisco flourished in the late nineteenth century, until a devastating earthquake in April of 1906 and its resulting fires leveled the city. “San Francisco: City of the World” explores the iconic city’s colorful history from the late nineteenth century to the 1980s.  See “San Francisco: City of the World” on display, post-security, in Terminal 2 and online at: https://bit.ly/SFCityOfTheWorld  SFO Museum respectfully acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush Ohlone—the original, present, and future inhabitants and stewards of the San Francisco Peninsula. Please join us in recognizing and honoring Ramaytush Ohlone ancestors, descendants, and all Indigenous communities who have inhabited and will continue to inhabit the Bay Area for hundreds of generations.",
