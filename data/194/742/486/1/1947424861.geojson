        "body": "Do you ever wonder how SFO Museum creates our exhibitions? We mockup every exhibition in our exhibition design lab before installation in our galleries. All exhibitions are planned and designed in stages. For the initial layout stage, armed with the list of objects, our exhibition designer and curators decide on how objects will be placed and grouped together to tell a cohesive story. Then, our exhibition designer begins working on the layout of the objects; in this instance, using paper facsimiles and cardboard cut outs in the place of 3D objects.  This includes considering the height of an object in relation to other objects, its angle, and what pieces should be grouped together on platforms or risers. As the exhibition design for our upcoming show evolved and progressed, our designer switched out the facsimiles for the actual objects that will be on display.  Kudos to our exhibition design team!  Stay tuned to see more behind the scenes from our upcoming exhibition, “San Francisco: City of the World!”",
