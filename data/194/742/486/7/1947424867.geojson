        "body": "One of Africa’s most revered and ancient percussion instruments, drums, are carved from solid logs of wood and covered with a stretch membrane. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They may be single-headed, open at one end and closed at the other, or double-headed and struck by hand or with drumsticks. The drum shown here, from Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, is intricately carved with figures adorned with necklaces.  Special thank you to the Fowler Museum at UCLA for making this exhibition possible. See \"The Art of the African Instrument\" on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/African-Instruments",
