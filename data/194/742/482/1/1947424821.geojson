He was also close friends with Andy Warhol who created the sets for one of Fine’s plays. He worked with Pan Am to create a number of posters promoting the airline’s worldwide destinations. In this mid-century masterpiece Fine featured London’s red double-decker buses with Piccadilly Circus in the background and the iconic British brands Bovril and Schweppes.
