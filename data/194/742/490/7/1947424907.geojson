        "body": "Born in Tokyo, Marc Katano graduated from the California College of the Arts in Oakland, CA with distinction in 1975. His work combines the grace of traditional calligraphic brush work with the gestural energy of Abstract Expressionism. The artist says, “[t]he basis of my work is the act of inscription. While my compositions are organic in form, they are not intended to emulate nature. Instead, they are inspired by the physicality of human expression, such as the precise motions of Japanese calligraphy. I use the simplest, most natural movements of the hand and arm to reflect the physical activity of mark making. Each line and form represents nothing more than its own creation, and each piece finds meaning in the harmony of its own structure.”  See “Greeting a Totem” and “Torso” by Marc Katano pre-security in Terminal 2 and online at: https://bit.ly/3SkyGO4  #MarcKatano #publicart sfac_public_art_collection",
