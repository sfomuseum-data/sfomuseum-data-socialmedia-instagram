        "body": "One of Haiti’s most celebrated metal sculptors, Serge Jolimeau (b. 1952) began an apprenticeship as an adolescent when very few sculptors worked in the medium of cut metal. After training with Sérésier Louisjuste, he joined Le Centre d’Art in 1972 where he met and was further mentored by Murat Brièrre (1938–88). Jolimeau often creates large-scale, two-dimensional sculptures in the form of bold, sensuous mermaids or sirens. Since childhood, he has observed and admired birds, which also appear frequently in his work. For decades, the artist has inspired and nurtured fledgling metal sculptors in the under-served town of Croix-des-Bouquets. Like Gabriel Bien-Aimé (b. 1951), Jolimeau fled Croix-des-Bouquets in the fall of 2022 as gangs overtook the artistic village of Noailles. He set up a workshop in the town of Mirebalais, approximately forty miles northeast of his hometown.
