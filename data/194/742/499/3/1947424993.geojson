        "body": "San Francisco’s 54th annual Pride Parade is this Sunday, June 30th. #OnThisDay in 1978, Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California, gave one of his most powerful speeches “My Name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you”, at the Gay Freedom Day, a predecessor of today’s Pride Parade. Milk, the newly elected San Francisco Board of Supervisor representing District 5 which included the Castro neighborhood, issued a call to action for all gays and lesbians to proudly come out of the closet. “Gay brothers and sisters, … You must come out. Come out to your parents. I know that it is hard and that it will hurt them, but think of how they will hurt you in the voting booth! Come out to your relatives. I know that it is hard and will upset them but think of how they will upset you in the voting booth. Come out to your friends. If indeed, they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, to your co-workers, to the people who work where you eat and shop. Come out only to the people you know, and who know you. Not to anyone else. But once and for all, break down the myths, destroy the lies and distortions.”  Learn more about Harvey Milk's life and legacy in our exhibition, \"Messenger of Hope,\" which is on view pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1.
