        "body": "Initially, Congress banned Concorde service to the United States due to concerns over the aircraftâ€™s sonic boom, but on May 24, 1976, an exception was made for transatlantic service to Washington Dulles International Airport from London and Paris. These supersonic transatlantic flights at 1,350 mph required just three and one-half hours, faster than the sun moves across the Earth. In a promotional brochure, Air France placed the event in historical perspective by recounting Charles Lindberghâ€™s thirty-three-hour transatlantic flight just forty-nine years earlier. The charge for a round-trip Air France Concorde ticket from Washington, DC to Paris was $1,654 (more than $8,700 today when adjusted for inflation). In November 1977, Concorde service was added to New Yorkâ€™s John F. Kennedy International Airport.  ðŸ“¸: poster: British Airways, Concorde; 1980s Gift of the William Hough Collection 2006.010.423  https://qr.sfomuseum.org/44Yuusw",
