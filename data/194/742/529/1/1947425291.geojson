The museum’s mission is to challenge visitors with recollections of items they may have lived with, and to suggest the influence of those objects on popular culture and the American public. In the 1980s, when visitors walked into the Unknown Museum’s front yard at 243 East Blithedale Avenue in Mill Valley, they were greeted by a wood-framed mirror that proclaimed, “This Is Your Life.” Assembled in every room and living space, the collection’s domestic setting reflected the “original intent” of the items—showcasing the previously commonplace artifacts of American consumerism at home.   A very special thank you to Mickey McGowan for making this exhibition possible. See “Recollections… from the Unknown Museum” on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. https://bit.ly/UnknownMuseum",
