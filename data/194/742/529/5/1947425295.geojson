        "body": "“Topograph I \u0026 II” by Kendall Buster consists of two conversant forms suspended on either side of the mezzanine above the departure lobby of Terminal 2. The project reflects the artist’s ongoing interest in the merging of natural and built environments and her investigations into forms that operate at once as landscape and architecture. Suggesting a topography map, the sculptures consist of stacked, shaped planes made from powder-coated steel tubing and greenhouse shade cloth. This durable material and construction method allows for maximum volume with minimal weight and allows light to penetrate the structure. The suspended shapes create an illusion that the forms have decompressed and expanded and that the two visible sculptures might be fragments of a larger mysterious mass, like clouds. The sculpture may be interpreted in many ways, but the suggestion of immateriality—a frozen moment before a totally new form emerges—is the artist’s objective.
