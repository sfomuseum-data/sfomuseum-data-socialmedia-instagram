        "body": "For “Long Arc of Day,” by Kim Anno, Anno combined historical scenes of the San Francisco Bay and the surrounding California landscape into one image. Anno created the tableaux by collaging and layering glass with pigment color drawings that were based on historical engravings. The image begins with a view of the bay and a Ramaytush Ohlone fisherman pulling a tule boat leading to agricultural scenes, then to the wilderness of the headwaters in the California Sierra Mountains. This work is emblematic of Kim Anno's artistic practice, which reimagines the study of nature in the face of climate change.   See “Long Arc of Day” by Kim Anno, in the post-security connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 and online at: https://bit.ly/3VW3ofw",
