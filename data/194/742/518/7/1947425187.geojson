        "body": "Harold McMillan Bixby, a midwestern businessman with a strong interest in the emerging technology of aviation, worked for Pan American Airways in the 1930s to the 1950s. The Harold Bixby Collection, acquired by SFO Museum in 2019, contains over five hundred photographic prints and negatives collected by Harold Bixby throughout his career.  Some of the photographs were likely taken by Bixby himself, but most were taken by others documenting events and individuals of interest to Bixby. The photographic collection has particularly good representation in three main areas: the aviation scene at Lambert Field in St. Louis in the 1920s, the operations of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) in the 1930s, and the arrival of Pan American’s inaugural transpacific flight in Manila in 1935.   Our photography essay “Unlocking an Archival Treasure: The Harold Bixby Collection, The Photographs” featuring twenty-one highlights from Harold Bixby’s life with Pan American, is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is located pre-security in the International Terminal and open daily from 10am to 4:30pm.",
