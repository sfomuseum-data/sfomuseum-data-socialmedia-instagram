Turpen Aviation Museum is an architectural adaptation of the 1937 terminal’s interior and incorporates many similar architectural features. The Aviation Museum features a similarly patterned terrazzo floor and arched side. The 1937 air terminal was just 88 feet by 206 feet, about 18,000 square feet, with the waiting room measuring in at 83 feet by 43 feet. Can you believe the waiting room was just that small and held all arriving and departing passengers? The Aviation Museum and Library currently measures in at  55 feet by 28 feet.   photograph: San Francisco Airport, Administration Building lobby interior; 01/12/1940 Transfer from San Francisco International Airport 1997.52.078.001",
