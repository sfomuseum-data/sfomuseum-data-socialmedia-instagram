        "body": "Enamel artist June Schwarcz was not trained in metalworking or enameling; rather, she studied industrial design at Pratt Institute. She was introduced to enamels in 1954 through a group of friends, one of whom had studied with Kenneth Bates, author of \"Enameling: Principles and Practice.\" Schwarcz moved to Sausalito, California, that year and began working in basse-taille, layering enamels over copper items with etched, chased, or engraved designs. After just a few months, the de Young Museum in San Francisco presented her first major exhibition, a two-person show with textile artist Trude Guermonprez (1910–76). Two years later, one of Schwarcz’s works was included in \"Craftsmanship in a Changing World,\" the inaugural exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York.  A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible. See “June Schwarcz: Unconventional Enamels,” on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/UnconventionalEnamels",
