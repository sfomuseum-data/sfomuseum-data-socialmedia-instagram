        "body": "Bay Area artist and educator Libby Black invited a group of undergraduate and graduate students from San Francisco State University’s School of Art to articulate their unique perspectives on home. Artists from a wide range of cultures and gender identities used a variety of mediums and techniques to examine their search to find a sense of belonging and safety. Watercolor, ink, acrylic paint, colored pencil, gouache, cannabis ink, and gold leaf were among the materials chosen by the artists to address this theme.  Living and working in the Bay Area, these students confront the challenges of pursuing their art in a region where affordable housing and studio space are scarce. As artist Ella Rose Avery writes, “We have all struggled to stay in the place we are from and love.” Together these amazing student artists create poignant and thought-provoking representations of the power of art as a language through which diverse voices convey their journeys to find their place in the world.  “Finding Home” by students from San Francisco State University, is on display, pre-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. https://www.sfomuseum.org/exhibitions/finding-home",
