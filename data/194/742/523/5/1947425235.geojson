        "body": "To create his sculptures, visionary Haitian artist, Georges Liautaud (1899–1991) first made a rough drawing on paper, or simply drew the shape of the figure freehand onto the metal. Liautaud then placed the piece on his anvil and, using a chisel and hammer or shears, cut the form from the metal sheet. He carefully filed and smoothed the edges of the pieces—though he might intentionally leave some areas rough. Liautaud employed a small hammer with a round tip to make subtle hollows in the metal to give his sculptures more dimension. He applied face details to figural sculptures, incising hair and adding eyelashes. Finally, Liautaud often bent different parts of the sculpture to add even more depth before cutting and attaching a support to enable the figure to stand.  See “The Enduring Spirit of Haitian Metal Sculpture” on display, pre-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/HaitianMetal",
