        "body": "From its founding, the Kalo Shop in Chicago proved to be an innovator in Arts and Crafts design, known for consistent quality and originality. Some of the shop’s trademarks included applied initials and interlocking monograms, hammer marks, rolled wire rims, and lobed designs. In addition, its progressive work environment and the inclusion of women made the Kalo Shop unique. By 1903, jewelry and metalwork production gained precedence at the Kalo Shop when artisan Mable Conde Dickson joined the partnership, and in 1904, Hanna C. Beye (1879–1965) merged her jewelry practice into the Kalo Shop.   In 1908, Kalo Shop founder, Clara Barck Welles established a school for aspiring women metalwork designers and jewelers at her Arts Crafts Community House, which she had established in Park Ridge, Illinois. By 1911, the school was managed by some of her most prominent students, including Mildred Belle Bevis and later, Esther L. Meacham.

Lee International Terminal Departures Hall and online at: https://bit.ly/BarckWelles",
