        "body": "This DC-3 seat typically used in day-use configurations was covered in fabric, amply cushioned, and represented the introduction of foam rubber on airliner seats. First created by Dunlop Rubber in 1929, foam rubber was used in many cushioning products by the late 1930s. The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company promoted its Foamex brand by claiming “nothing cuts flying fatigue like Foamex” and promising “resilience and softness in one zephyr-light material.” The seat is framed in aluminum tubing and features a spring-loaded pivot mechanism that simultaneously slides the seat forward while allowing the back to recline to thirty degrees from the normal upright setting of fifteen degrees. The chair also has plastic sidewalls giving it a clean, streamlined look. Some chairs aboard the DC-3 included holders under the seat for round paper cartons, commonly called burp cups, in case of motion sickness. Washable linen covers, known as antimacassars, were often fitted over the headrest to prevent hair oil from soiling the fabric. For extra comfort, airlines also offered passengers pillows and blankets.  See “Remain Seated: Airliner Passenger Chairs,” on display, pre-security in the Aviation Museum and Library, located on the departures level of the International Terminal and online at: https://bit.ly/AirlinerChairs",
