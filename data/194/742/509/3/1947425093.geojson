This 1972 United Air Lines poster featured Hilo Hattie, a famous Native Hawaiian singer and entertainer. Known as Clara Nelson (1901-1979) offstage, she was a former schoolteacher, who’s show was described by the Daytona Beach Morning Journal as, “comedy with an authentic background with no satire, no bite, no ridicule, no sarcasm.” In honor for her 71st birthday and United Air Lines' fifth anniversary of service to Hilo, Hawaii, in 1972, the airline named a DC-8 after her.   poster: United Air Lines, Hawaii; 1972 Gift of United Airlines Archives 1999.047.624 https://ow.ly/zKgt50QSRIw",
