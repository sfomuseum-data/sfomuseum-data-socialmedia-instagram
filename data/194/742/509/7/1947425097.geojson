After a long and hard-fought battle with the CAB and PAA, TWA (Trans World Airlines) was awarded certification to cross the North Atlantic in 1945. This opened up more travel possibilities for passengers as TWA could now operate domestically in the United States and internationally to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.  TWAâ€™s first transatlantic proving flight to Paris took place on November 25, 1945; regular service from New York to Paris commenced on February 5, 1946.   poster: TWA (Trans World Airlines), Lockheed L-1649 Constellation, Paris; c. 1957 Collection of SFO Museum 1995.03.01 https://ow.ly/mmtP50QM9RW",
