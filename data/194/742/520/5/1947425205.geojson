When Pan American was founded in 1927, the companyâ€™s first president, Juan Trippe, had a dream of building an air transport system across entire oceans. This dream was realized over the next few decades, when Pan American inaugurated transpacific and transatlantic scheduled service from the United States to the Caribbean, Asia, Oceania, and Europe.  What are your favorite memories of Pan American?  postcard: Pan American Airways, Miami, Florida; c. 1935 Gift of the Captain John B. Russell Family 2012.149.0501",
