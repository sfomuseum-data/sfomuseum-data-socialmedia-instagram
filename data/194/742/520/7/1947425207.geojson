In 1927, Bixby joined a group of businessmen to help finance Charles Lindbergh’s (1902-74) historic transatlantic flight later that year. Bixby celebrated with the famous pilot after his arrival in St. Louis during the 1928 Goodwill Tour of the Americas. Bixby and Lindbergh remained lifelong friends.   “Unlocking an Archival Treasure: The Harold Bixby Collection” is on display in the Aviation Museum and Library.
