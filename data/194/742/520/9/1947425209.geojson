Prior to 1930, airlines hired only male stewards to serve passenger needs in their airliner cabins. Boeing Air Transport—later United Air Lines—was the first to hire women as stewardesses in 1930, beginning with Ellen Church (1904–65). A licensed pilot and registered nurse, Church initially applied to fly for the airline but was denied because of her gender. Undeterred, she convinced Boeing’s district manager Steve Stimpson (1896–1974) to hire her as an inflight nurse, as well as seven other female nurses, in a three-month trial to help alleviate passengers’ fear of flying. Employment of these “sky girls” as they came to be known, was popular with the flying public and led to other airlines employing women as stewardesses and hostesses.
