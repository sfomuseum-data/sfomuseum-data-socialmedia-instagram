        "body": "In July of 2021, marking his fiftieth year as a sculptor, Gabriel Bien-Aim√© traveled to the International Folk Art Market in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for the first time. The event fell one week after the assassination of Haiti‚Äôs president Jovenel Mo√Øse (1968‚Äì2021). In the state of siege that followed, all of Haiti‚Äôs airports were closed. The Port-au-Prince airport reopened a day before Bien-Aim√© was due in Santa Fe. Bien-Aim√© arrived with his sculptures packed in two large suitcases, leaving just enough time to hang his artwork and successfully conclude a sold-out show. Though Bien-Aim√© planned to return to Haiti, the country‚Äôs instability led him to remain in the United States for over a year. During this time, he worked in the service industry to support himself and was unable to create sculptures for the 2022 art market. In the summer of 2022, Indigo Arts Gallery in conjunction with Galerie Bonheur promoted sales of Bien-Aim√©‚Äôs existing work to help raise funds to enable him to return to Haiti, establish a new workshop, and purchase materials to create new sculptures. The infiltration of gangs in Croix-des-Bouquets drove Bien-Aim√© to move to Hinche in central Haiti in the fall of 2022. Bien-Aim√© returned to Santa Fe in July of 2023 to participate in the International Folk Art Market.
