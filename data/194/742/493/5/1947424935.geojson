Amid concerns that CEO (Chief Executive Officer) Fred Reid might also be unduly influenced by the Virgin Group, he was replaced by C. David Cush, who remained CEO until 2016. With SFO selected as its base, and Burlingame chosen as the site of its corporate headquarters, the airline, now called Virgin America, was finally cleared to fly in May 2007. In July of that year, Virgin America began setting fares and selling tickets, and in August, flights were inaugurated between New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
