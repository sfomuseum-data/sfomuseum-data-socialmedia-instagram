        "body": "Not all posters produced by airlines advertised their service destinations. In 1973, advertising executive George S. Gordon negotiated on Braniff's behalf with the world-renowned artist Alexander Calder to paint an entire Douglas DC-8-62, transforming it into a flying work of art. Braniff produced numerous advertisements to promote their new livery including this poster. This aircraft, named \"Flying Colors of South America,\" entered service in 1973 on routes between the U.S. and premier South American destinations. Gordon, confident that the aircraft would be so strongly associated with Braniff by reputation, did not place the Braniff International logotype anywhere on the plane's exterior. Do you have a favorite airline livery?  ðŸ“¸: poster: Braniff International, Douglas DC-8-62; c. 1974 Gift of Thomas G. Dragges 2015.109.020  https://bit.ly/3Y2YAtd",
