Each mannequin can take from a few hours to a week to craft. Our mannequins are custom-made using a heat-malleable material called Fosshape, which is covered by an archival fabric as a barrier to protect the uniforms. Here one of our preparators is hemming the archival fabric at the end of one of the legs on a custom-made mannequin for the upcoming exhibition, “Rosie the Riveter: Womanpower in Wartime,” opening soon! Stay tuned for more updates!",
