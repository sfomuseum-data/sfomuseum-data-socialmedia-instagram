The Unknown Museum was conceived as a hands-on experience, encouraging visitors to physically interact with stacks and shelves full of items. When confronted with so many common objects from years past, visitors often asked curator Mickey McGowan to see a specific item, and then proceeded to search for it among a multitude of similar things. The process evoked familiarity, comfort, and was thought-provoking. The museum’s mission is to challenge visitors with recollections of items they may have lived with, and to suggest the influence of those objects on popular culture and the American public. The personal connections held by visitors are the “secrets” behind the Unknown Museum.  The Unknown Museum continues as a private museum and lending archives. This exhibition presents a sampling of the fantastic art and object installations from various locations of the Unknown Museum.  A very special thank you to Mickey McGowan for making this exhibition possible. See “Recollections… from the Unknown Museum” on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. https://bit.ly/UnknownMuseum",
