        "body": "Born in Australia in 1929, Harry Rogers was a poster artist and graphic designer for Qantas from the late 1950s through the â€˜80s. He designed the Qantas logo-font in the mid-1960s and created numerous travel posters for the airline from the 1950s to the â€™70s. For each poster series, Rogers conceived a distinct style using different illustration techniques. These included cut paper and collage, animal portraits, watercolor illustrations, and oil paintings on glass. He served as director for the Qantas inflight and staff magazines from 1976 to 1984 and designed safety brochures and oversaw Qantas branding from 1970 to 1984.
