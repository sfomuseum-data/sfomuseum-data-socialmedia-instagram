        "body": "This cutaway model of the Western Airlines Lockheed L-188A Electra turboprop was created by Gary Field (b. 1956) and was closely based on travel agency models of the Electra that were produced by the model maker Osgaard of Denmark in the late 1950s. It represents the first Electra delivered to Western, registered as N7135C, and features a highly detailed fuselage, wings, engines, cockpit, and cabin interior with a galley, luggage racks, closets, and a lounge. The illusion of realism is enhanced by the placement of unique, individually crafted plastic figurines of passengers and flight crew.
