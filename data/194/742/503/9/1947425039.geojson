        "body": "City College of San Francisco (CCSF) is an urban community college with affordable, high-quality instruction, and evening and weekend classes. From 1975 through 2020, CCSF held popular art classes at their campus located in Fort Mason. This campus offered instruction in a variety of artistic disciplines, including ceramics, painting, sculpture, and printmaking. The prints in \"45 Years of Fine Art Printmaking at City College of San Francisco’s Fort Mason Campus\" are excellent examples of students using traditional printmaking techniques to realize their creative visions. They are also a testament to the dedicated and inspiring CCSF printmaking instructors who taught these techniques at the Fort Mason campus during this forty-five-year period.  The exhibition was co-curated by current CCSF Art Department instructor Anthony Ryan and retired instructors Anna Asebedo and Robin Kaneshiro. See \"45 Years of Fine Art Printmaking at City College of San Francisco’s Fort Mason Campus\" on display, pre-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/4aVFl8v",
