        "body": "Fiber artist, Kay Sekimachi  is Nisei, a second-generation Japanese American, born in San Francisco’s Japantown in 1926. Sekimachi’s series of monofilament sculptures began in 1963 as an experiment to weave a wall hanging in multiple, translucent layers. After weaving a linen sample, Sekimachi realized she could produce three-dimensional forms using a nylon monofilament material (now commonly known as fishing line) that DuPont introduced in 1959. Due to their complexity, each of Sekimachi's monofilament design was carefully plotted on graph paper prior to weaving. As she developed her first series, Sekimachi’s monofilament sculptures grew progressively larger and more intricate. In the last version of this series, each inch of multilayered monofilament required more than an hour to weave.   A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible. See \"Kay Sekimachi: Weaving Traditions\" on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. https://www.sfomuseum.org/exhibitions/kay-sekimachi-weaving",
