        "body": "What’s happening at the museum? We are getting ready for our new upcoming exhibition on decorative tile from California! In preparation for installation, a mount must be made for certain objects. An object’s mount is comprised of a brass bracket that will be painted to blend-in with the object. Our preparators meticulously paint every mount to match the colors of the object, mixing paint colors to get exact shades that become as unnoticeable as possible. Finally, a layer of felt or microsuede will be applied to the mount to protect the object from the metal.   Stay tuned for more behind the scenes sneak peeks from our upcoming exhibition, “California Decorative Tile.” https://bit.ly/3UnbdNf",
