        "body": "Tile evokes the warm and artistic nature of California along with the historic character of its past. Introduced to the state during Spanish occupation, tile remained a central decorative element in the early twentieth century. Arts and Crafts-style bungalows showcased tile with picturesque scenes and natural motifs rendered in earthy tones. In Spanish Colonial Revival-style homes, decorative tile in bold patterns and brightly colored glazes accentuated terra cotta roof and floor tiles. Many California kitchens and bathrooms still feature extensive tilework, while tile adorns fireplace surrounds, staircase risers, fountains, and patios.   The finest tiles produced in California from the 1910s to the 1940s stand as a testament to the state‚Äôs rich architectural history. This exhibition features decorative California tile by Los Angeles and Bay Area companies from the collection of the Tile Heritage Foundation.  A very special thank you to Tile Heritage Foundation for making this exhibition possible. See ‚ÄúCalifornia Decorative Tile‚Äù on display, pre-security, in the Mayor Edwin M.
