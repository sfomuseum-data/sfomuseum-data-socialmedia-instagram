Milk was the first openly gay elected official in the state of California. Elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Milk represented District 5, which included Castro Street. Milk campaigned for gay rights and along San Francisco Mayor George Moscone helped pass a city ordinance authored by Milk that banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment and housing. Milk and Moscone were assassinated in 1978 by former Board of Supervisors member Dan White.
