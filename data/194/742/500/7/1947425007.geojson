        "body": "The Louisjuste brothers—Sérésier, Janvier, and Joseph (1940–89) were born in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti. They learned to sculpt in metal from visionary artist Georges Liautaud (1899–1991) and began garnering international attention for their work in the 1970s. The brothers developed a similar artistic style, often embellishing the surfaces of their sculptures with lively incised lines. Although the three worked as individual sculptors, they also collaborated on pieces. The brothers played an integral role in disseminating cut-metal sculpture to numerous other fledgling artists in Croix-des-Bouquets. Gabriel Bien-Aimé (b. 1951) and Serge Jolimeau (b. 1952)—the two most revered contemporary Haitian metal sculptors—both studied under the Louisjuste brothers. The Louisjuste brothers’ work is held in several permanent museum collections in the United States, including the Lowe Art Museum in Miami, Florida, and the Figge Art Museum in Davenport, Iowa.   See “The Enduring Spirit of Haitian Metal Sculpture” on display, pre-security, in the Mayor Edwin M. Lee International Terminal Departures Hall and online at: hhttps://bit.ly/Haitian-Metal",
