One of the leading silver shops in the Arts and Crafts era, the Kalo Shop greatly influenced silver production in the Chicago area. Popular with Kalo Shop customers, many compote designs remained in production for decades. The broad decorative fluting on the base of this compote required specialized expertise from an experienced silversmith.
