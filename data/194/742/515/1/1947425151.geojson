        "body": "Harvey Bernard Milk (1930–78) was a visionary human rights leader, a groundbreaking political luminary, and a seminal figure of the LGBTQ rights movement. In this speech written around 1975, Milk describes how the Castro neighborhood came to represent his home. While San Francisco’s Polk Street had been home to much of the city’s LGBTQ population during the 1950s and 1960s, the center of gravity shifted south to the area surrounding Castro Street, which was known as a safe haven for gays and lesbians by the time of Milk’s arrival in 1972.  Learn more about Harvey Milk's life and legacy in our exhibition, \"Messenger of Hope,\" which is on view pre-security in Harvey Milk Terminal 1. Not traveling? The exhibition catalog is available to read online! http://bit.ly/HarveyMilkExhibition",
