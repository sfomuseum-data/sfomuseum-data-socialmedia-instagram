        "body": "Virgin America was founded in 2004 by the Virgin Group to offer a more pleasurable domestic airline flying experience to the traveling public. Headquartered in nearby Burlingame, California, the carrier built a large and particularly loyal customer base through a unique blend of style, equipment, and services. These included leather seats, cabin mood lighting, premium entertainment systems with a broad range of audiovisual programming, full-service meals, and friendly, enthusiastic flight and ground crews dressed in hip, casual uniforms. The airline primarily focused on offering superior economy services while also providing competitive first-class amenities. The carrierâ€™s flight crews were known for fostering a fun, relaxed, and enjoyable cabin atmosphere that was reminiscent of earlier California carriers, such as PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines) and Hughes Airwest.  See \"VX Forever: The Legacy of Virgin America\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library, located pre-security, in the International Terminal, open daily from 10am to 4:30pm. https://www.sfomuseum.org/exhibitions/vx-forever",
