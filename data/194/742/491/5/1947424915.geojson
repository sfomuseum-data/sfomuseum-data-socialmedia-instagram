        "body": "Pan American World Airways expanded its routes during the postwar years to include the newly independent countries of India and Pakistan, as well as Thailand (formerly Siam). After traveling to India on Pan American in 1949, Charles Baskerville created this colorful composition with several recognizable themes and landmarks of the subcontinent. An elephant and its riders, lavishly adorned in gold and red, are shown with a pouncing Bengal tiger. Baskerville depicted white cows, sacred to the Hindu religion, and the unmistakable silhouette of the Taj Mahal, the seventeenth-century tomb of the Mogul emperor Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal.   See \"Artists of the Airways: Airline Travel Posters from the SFO Museum Collection\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library.
