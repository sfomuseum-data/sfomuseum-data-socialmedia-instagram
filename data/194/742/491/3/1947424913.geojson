        "body": "With paper and X-Acto blades, Tahiti Pehrson hand-cuts intricately patterned forms that speak to universal traditions of pattern making found throughout history. For this installation, the artist digitally scanned his original cut-paper artwork so that it could be fabricated using laser jet cut aluminum. Using moiré patterns that reference the realms of mathematics, arts and crafts, this work explores the interplay between light, shadow and architectural space. Perceptions of volume and structure shift as the light changes throughout the day, and as the viewer moves around the work.
