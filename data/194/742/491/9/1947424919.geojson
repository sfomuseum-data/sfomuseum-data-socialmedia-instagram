TV has been my biggest influence; it started about the year I was born, and I‚Äôm a perfect example of what it can do to you‚Äîfor better or for worse.‚Äù ‚ÄîMickey McGowan, 1993  The Unknown Museum has prominently featured the television. Mickey McGowan utilized hollowed-out sets as enclosures for many of his dioramas. He assembled stacks of televisions in various outdoor yard installations. At times, McGowan adjusted the signal of a working television placed in an indoor exhibit so all that appeared on the screen was a solitary horizontal line. He mixed jingles from early TV commercials onto audio tapes that played music and excerpts from movies, sitcoms, serials, and newscasts from the era. Audio volume rose and fell in a constant soundtrack; the ‚ÄúPerfect Moment‚Äù occurred when a direct connection was made‚Äîfor example, if the Rice Krispies jingle randomly played while a visitor was looking at the ad characters Snap, Crackle, and Pop in the kitchen area of the museum.   A very special thank you to Mickey McGowan for making this exhibition possible.
