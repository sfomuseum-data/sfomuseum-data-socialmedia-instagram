        "body": "Our newest exhibition is now on display in Harvey Milk Terminal 1! Pioneering Bay Area artist June Schwarcz (1918–2015) made unconventional enameled art for more than sixty years. Self-trained in metalworking, Schwarcz pioneered electroforming, an innovative method that involved electroplating pieces made from thin copper foil or screen.   A very special thank you to Forrest L. Merrill for making this exhibition possible. See “June Schwarcz: Unconventional Enamels,” on display, post-security, in Harvey Milk Terminal 1 and online at: https://bit.ly/UnconventionalEnamels",
