        "body": "The Boeing 40 embarked on its maiden flight in July 1925. The first Boeing aircraft built to carry passengers, the Boeing 40 was primarily used as an air mail plane. As a result of the Kelly Act of 1925 and the Air Mail Act of 1926, newly created airlines scrambled to obtain lucrative and profitable air mail contracts from the federal government. Boeing Air Transport, which would later become United Air Lines, introduced the Boeing 40 on July 1, 1927.   Boeing Air Transport inaugurated commercial operations at SFO on October 17, 1927, with airmail service flown on a Boeing 40.  negative: Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco, Boeing 40A; 1927 Transfer from San Francisco International Airport 2011.032.0035 https://bit.ly/3CXf6zn",
