        "body": "Principal dancer Joseph Walsh (b. 1990), who has frequently performed the lead role in 𝘚𝘸𝘪𝘮𝘮𝘦𝘳, began his early training at Walnut Hill School for the Arts in Massachusetts before joining the Houston Ballet in 2006. Walsh says that one of the primary reasons he decided to join San Francisco Ballet in 2014 as a soloist was because he felt “drawn by the amount of new material they were putting on, the new pieces, the new choreography.” Wei Wang (b. 1993), who also performs in 𝘚𝘸𝘪𝘮𝘮𝘦𝘳, trained for seven years at the Beijing Dance Academy, beginning at age ten, before joining the San Francisco Ballet School’s Trainee Program in 2011. He was named an apprentice in 2012 and then joined the corps de ballet (group of dancers) in 2013. Wang was promoted to a soloist in 2016 and became a principal dancer in 2018.   Most professional dancers train at least ten years before joining a ballet company around age eighteen. San Francisco Ballet dancers come from all over the world to perform with the Company. Dancers train and rehearse an average of six hours each day, six days a week, in addition to devoting time outside of the studio conditioning and strength training. When compared to other non-athletic professions, ballet careers seem short. Most dancers retire sometime in their thirties, though some dancers continue.   Special thank you to San Francisco Ballet for making this exhibition possible.
