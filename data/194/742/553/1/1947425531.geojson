        "body": "North Carolina native Elizabeth Cotten (1895–1987) first picked up her brother’s banjo at the age of eight. Left-handed, she taught herself to play the right-handed guitar upside down. As a teenager, she was persuaded by the Baptist church to give up her “devil’s music.” In the 1940s, she began housekeeping for Ruth Crawford Seeger, a composer and stepmother of the famous folk singer Pete Seeger. Cotten got acquainted with their son, Mike Seeger, and began playing the guitar again. Cotten won a Grammy in 1985 at the age of ninety for best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording for her Arhoolie LP recording, which she recorded in her late eighties. Her finger-picking guitar style has been emulated by numerous folk-guitar players. \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://bit.ly/StoryofArhoolie",
