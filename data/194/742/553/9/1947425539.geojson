Morgan-Rhind has crafted an endearing profile of Fay and Joe Gock, who found an unlikely but enduring way to repay the country that granted them citizenship after escaping Japanese-occupied China in the 1940s. See \"How Mr and Mrs Gock Saved the Kumara\" and three other shorts now playing in the Video Arts screening room located pre-security in the International Terminal Main Hall. http://bit.ly/2SSpQVW",
