        "body": "Born in Centerville, Texas, country bluesman Lightnin’ Hopkins (1912–82) learned to play the guitar from his older brother John Henry  Hopkins. A prolific songwriter, he recorded nearly two-hundred songs  during his career, which began in the 1940s and ended in the early  1980s. Hopkins inspired Chris Strachwitz to start his Arhoolie record  label. In 1959, Strachwitz traveled to Houston, Texas, where he saw  Hopkins perform in an informal beer joint and was struck by his  improvised lyrics and spontaneous exchange with the audience. Arhoolie  would release its first recording of Hopkins in 1968.  http://ow.ly/wfIr50juhMq \"Down-Home Music: The Story of Arhoolie Records\" is on display, post-security, in Terminal 2. http://ow.ly/972U50juhMp",
