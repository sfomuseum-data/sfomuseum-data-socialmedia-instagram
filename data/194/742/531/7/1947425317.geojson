        "body": "Viola Frey was born on this day Lodi, California in 1933. Frey primarily worked in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Frey has created a vocabulary of figures and objects that form a personal mythology. For instance, the suited businessman is a symbol of mainstream respectability, often contrasted with bold, vividly dressed women. The grandmother figure is a maternal icon of power inspired by the “take charge” matriarchs in her hometown during World War II. The workman’s glove holds the world in its palm - a statement about the value of work and creativity.  See “World Civilization” by Viola Frey on display, post-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/3RNiP8T",
