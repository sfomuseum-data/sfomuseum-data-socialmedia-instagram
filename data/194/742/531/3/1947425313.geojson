The event drew hundreds of thousands of visitors, showcased forty-three aircraft for visitors to tour, and featured speeches from California Governor Goodwin J. Knight and San Francisco Mayor Elmer E. Robinson. Special guests of the event included Bernard M. “Mike” Doolin, former director of the airport who were issued this special guest badge.
