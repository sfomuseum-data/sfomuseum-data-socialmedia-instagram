In 1945, the airline was purchased by American Airlines and renamed American Overseas Airlines. A.O.A. was awarded routes to England, Iceland, Ireland, and other destinations in Europe and produced posters like this one in 1948 to promote those routes. On September 25, 1950, Pan American World Airways acquired A.O.A. from American Airlines. Once acquired, PAA obtained all of A.O.A. routes and assets including eight Boeing 377 Stratocruisers, seven Constellations, three DC-4s, and one DC-3.  ðŸ“¸: poster: American Overseas Airlines (AOA); 1948 Collection of SFO Museum 1992.01.02 https://bit.ly/4eAg6Kq",
