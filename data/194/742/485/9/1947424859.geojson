        "body": "Harry Rogers, a poster artist and graphic designer for Qantas from the late 1950s through the â€˜80s, created numerous travel posters for the airline from the 1950s to the â€™70s. In 1956, Rogers created a series of travel posters for the airline incorporating visual elements of animation in static format. Initially he depicted figures intended to represent various cultures, such as this Japan poster with a woman dressed in a kimono and this Ceylon (Sri Lanka) poster featuring a Kandyan dancer from the Central Hills region of Udarata. These were followed by the animal series for which he is best knownâ€”including the unmistakable kangaroo with Aboriginal-inspired design accents for Australia and the iconic bulldog for Britain. All the posters in this series included a small Lockheed Super Constellation in shadow.  See \"Artists of the Airways: Airline Travel Posters from the SFO Museum Collection\" on display in the Aviation Museum and Library. The Aviation Museum and Library is located pre-security, in the International Terminal. https://bit.ly/AirwaysArtists  #AirwaysArtists #AvGeek  ðŸ“¸: Qantas Empire Airways Japan travel poster  c. 1956 Harry Rogers paper, ink Collection of SFO Museum Gift of Thomas G.
