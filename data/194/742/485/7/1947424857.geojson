        "body": "Although Virgin America was still not realizing a profit after six years of operations, the carrier built a solid reputation for delivering an improved passenger experience at a competitive price. The airline was also buoyed by a large and loyal customer base. Many of its passengers, if offered the choice, would fly no other airline, even if the ticket price on a particular route might be slightly less on another carrier. This rapid growth in popularity came from Virgin America‚Äôs efforts to offer a truly fun travel experience unlike any other available in the industry at the time. With Virgin America, the passenger experience always came first. In 2013, The New York Times described the airline as ‚Äúa flirty package of self-awareness and charisma bathed in purplish mood lighting that has earned glowing consumer reviews and challenged the idea that an airline can‚Äôt wow its passengers.‚Äù The source of Virgin America‚Äôs corporate culture was easy to identify‚Äîit was Sir Richard Branson, the creative innovator of numerous other Virgin companies in fields ranging from music to space travel.
